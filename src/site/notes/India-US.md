## Irritants in India-US relations
### Defence and Security
- The US Navy's sail through the waters off Lakshadweep highlights a gap in the Indian and American perception of navigational freedoms.
	- US navy conducted FONOP (Freedom Of Navigation Operation) in India's EEZ. US said it was challenging India's excessive maritime claims. US has not ratified UNCLOS. 
- Sudden exit of US troops from Afghanistan.

	- This is Washington's first major security assistance to Islamabad in four years.

#### CAATSA
- Countering Americas Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), passed in 2017 provided for economic and travel sanctions against countries and officials that transacted significant military and intelligence contacts with Russia, North Korea and Iran.
- [[India-Russia\|India-Russia]] conducted their transfers for S-400 Triumpf system through a rupee-ruble system.
- CAATSA was used against China and Turkey (NATO partner).
##### Impact of CAATSA
- Sanctions could spur India towards Russia.
- Sanctions also undermine multilateral system.
- It could affect India-US global strategic partnership.
- It challenges nation's [[SOVEREIGNITY\|SOVEREIGNITY]] and strategic autonomy.
- Rather than trying for an exceptional waiver, New Delhi should force US to abandon the law to protect rule-based international order.
### Divergence in Foreign policies
- Trump's West Asia policy was majorly focused on containing Iran.
	- Yemen is case study for a war that has gone wrong on all fronts.
## Way forward
- Need to form a [[Green Hydrogen\|Green Hydrogen]] alliance.
- New Delhi must seize the opportunity (revival of TPF) to cement its place in the new supply chains being envisaged.

# Bronze age civilisation
>The technology of the systematic method of extracting ores and preparing new metals (metallurgy), like bronze paved way for the beginning of the first civilization in the history of mankind. These first civilizations were named as Bronze Age Civilizations. #introduction 
- Most important early civilizations, Mesopotamia, Egyptian, Minoan, Indian, and Chinese etc. arose in certain river valleys. It provided the fertility, alluvial land, water transport facilities etc. ==The cooperative activities of the people enabled them to develop early civilizations in these river valleys.==
- Discovery of metals replaced crude stone tools.
- Bronze Age primarily took place in between 3500 and 1200 BCE and is traditionally divided into Early, Middle and Later Bronze ages.
- In India the beginning of the Bronze Age took place in around 3300 BCE with the Harappan or Indus Valley civilization.
- The government has to make and record laws, maintain accounts, decide disputes and communicate with the people it is governing. Thus some form of writing has to be devised.

## Features of Civilizations: V. Gordon Childe
- Australian archaeologist and philologist who specialized in the study of European prehistory - The term "**urban revolution**" was introduced in the 1930s by V. Gordon Childe. Childe also coined the term **Neolithic Revolution** in 1935 to describe the earlier process by which Hunter-Gatherer Societies domesticated crops and animals and began a farming lifestyle - settled way of living. Thus by making an increasingly large population possible. ==Neolithic revolution is also called agricultural revolution.==
	- **Causes of Neolithic revolution**
		- The Earth entered a warming trend around 14,000 years ago at the end of the last **Ice Age**. Some scientists theorize that climate changes drove the Agricultural Revolution. e.g. Humans began to grow wild wheat and barley as it got warmer. Traces of permanent houses have been found from this region. These early farmers also domesticated lentils, chickpeas, peas and flax.
		- Other scientists suggest that intellectual advances in the human brain may have caused people to settle down. Religious artifacts and artistic imagery have been uncovered from earliest neolithic settlements.	
	- **Impact of neolithic revolution**
		- It paved the way for the innovations of the ensuing Bronze Age and Iron Age, when advancements in creating tools for farming, wars and art swept the world and brought civilizations together through trade and conquest.
### 10 point model for the changes that characterized the Urban revolution are:
1. Large population and large settlements (cities)
2. Full-time specialization and advanced division of labour
3. Production of an agricultural surplus to fund government and a differentiated society
4. Monumental public architecture
5. A ruling class
6. Writing
7. Exact and predictive sciences (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, calendars)
8. Sophisticated art styles
9. Long-distance trade
10. The state

## MESOPOTAMIA
- Mesopotamia land between rivers "land of rivers" is a name for the area of the **Tigris - Euphrates river system**, corresponding to modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, the north eastern section of Syria and to a much lesser extent south eastern Turkey and smaller parts of south western Iran.
- Widely considered to be the **cradle of civilization** by the Western world, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires, all native to the territory of modern-day Iraq. Later in the iron age and after that the region was controlled by various powers.
- ==Ur was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia==, once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf.
- City Seals (type of cylindrical seal) contain a set of proto-cuneiform signs which appear to be writings or symbols of the name of city states in ancient Sumer. Many of these seals have been found in Ur, and the name of Ur is prominent on them.
- The third dynasty was established when the king **Ur-Nammu** came to power, ruling between ca. 2047 BCE and 2030 BCE. During his rule, temples, including the **ziggurat**, were built, and agriculture was improved through irrigation. His code of laws, the ==Code of Ur-Nammu is one of the oldest such documents known, preceding the Code of Hammuf Ur-Nrabi by 300 years.==
- The houses in the city were two-storied villas with 13 or 14 rooms, with plastered interior walls.
- Early in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BCE) cuneiform was invented for the Sumerian language. Cuneiform literally means "wedge-shaped", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay. The standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from pictograms.
- Mesopotamian religion was the first to be recorded. Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, heaven.
- ==Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic.== Although the beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations.
- Code of Hammurabi (1780 BCE), which is one of the earliest sets of laws found and one of the best preserved examples of this type of document from ancient Mesopotamia. He codified over 200 laws for Mesopotamia.
- Laws of Lipit-Ishtar of about 1930 BCE, which deals primarily with laws of marriage, family and property.
- The basis of criminal law is that of equal retaliation, comparable to the Semitic law of “an eye for an eye”.
## Egypt
>Egyptian civilization of ancient North-eastern Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River in what is now the modern country of Egypt. It is one of six civilizations globally to arise independently. #introduction 
- Egyptian civilization coalesced around 3150 BCE with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh.
- ==The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture.==
- The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the quarrying, surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids, temples, and obelisks; a system of mathematics, a practical and effective system of medicine, irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known ships, Egyptian faience and glass technology, new forms of literature, and the earliest known peace treaty, made with the Hittites. 
- Hence Egypt left a lasting legacy. 
- Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society.
- The Egyptian language is a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to the Berber and Semitic languages. It has the second longest history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200 BCE to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer.
- Hieroglyphic writing dates from c. 3000 BCE, and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts.
- The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at.

## Chinese civilisation
- The long age of Chinese bronze age civilization began around 2000 BCE.
- Area along the Yellow River in present-day **Henan Province** emerged as the centre of the most advanced and literate cultures of the time and became the seat of the political and military power of the **Shang dynasty** (ca. 1600–1046 BCE), the earliest archaeologically recorded dynasty in Chinese history. 
- The Shang dynasty was conquered by the people of Zhou (1046–256 BCE), who came from farther up the Yellow River in the area of Xi’an in Shaanxi Province. 
- Unification of China happened in 221 BCE under Qin.
- Although there is uncertainty as to when metallurgy began in China, there is reason to believe that early bronze working developed autonomously, independent of outside influences. 
- The era of the Shang and the Zhou dynasties is generally known as the Bronze Age of China, because bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, used to fashion weapons, parts of chariots, and ritual vessels, played an important role in the material culture of the time. Iron appeared in China toward the end of the period, during the Eastern Zhou dynasty.
- The earliest Chinese bronzes were made by the method known as **piece-mould casting**-as opposed to the lost-wax method, which was used in all other Bronze Age cultures. 
- In piece-mould casting, a model is made of the object to be cast, and a clay mould taken of the model. The mould is then cut in sections to release the model, and the sections are reassembled after firing to form the mould for casting. If the object to be cast is a vessel, a core has to be placed inside the mould to provide the vessel’s cavity. The piece-mould method was most likely the only one used in China until at least the end of the Shang dynasty. An advantage of this rather cumbersome way of casting bronze was that the decorative patterns could be carved or stamped directly on the inner surface of the mould before it was fired. ==This technique enabled the bronze worker to achieve a high degree of sharpness and definition in even the most intricate designs.==

# HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION
- Total area - 13 lakh sqkm. Area wise it was larger than all other [[Bronze age civilisation\|Bronze age civilisation]]s. Diverse geographical features - river valley, coastal areas, hilly terrains etc.
- Period of Harappan civilization is divided into 3 phases;
	- Early Harappan age, **Regionalisation era** - 3500 BCE to 2600 BCE.
	- Mature Harappan or Urban Harappan - **Integration era** - 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE.
	- Late Harappan or **Localisation era**, **Post urban phase** - 1900 BCE onward.
- Mehragarh settlements in present day Baluchistan province of Pakistan predates IVC (7000 BCE). They produced wheat, cotton and lived in mud brick houses.

# Urban Planning in IVC
>To what extent has the urban planning and culture of the Indus Valley Civilization provided inputs to the present-day urbanization? Discuss. ( #PYMQ/anc/ivc #2014/200/12 )

>Would you agree that the drainage system in Harappan cities indicates town planning? Give reasons for your answer. #MPQ 

## Indicators of Urban planning in IVC
1. Grid system and street design: Roads were well cut dividing the town into large rectangular blocks. ==Lamp posts at intervals indicate the existence of street lightning.== Mesopotamia had haphazard (unplanned) growth.
2. Drainage system: The drains connecting from all the houses are connected to a near by central drain. Drains were made up of mortar, lime and gypsum and covered with large brick slabs for easy cleaning. It shows **developed sense of health and sanitation**. Manholes were constructed at regular intervals cleaning and maintenance. ==No other [[Bronze age civilisation\|Bronze age civilisation]] gave so much attention to the health and cleanliness as the Harappans did.== [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\|Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]]
3. Use of Burnt bricks of standard ratio: (length and breadth were four times and twice the height respectively) in all the sites. Elsewhere in contemporary world, mud-bricks were used. e.g. Egyptian Civilization.
4. Design of houses: Houses were monotonous - a square courtyard, around which were a number of rooms were built.
5. Mobilization of labour: huge walls and buildings.
6. Upper (citadel- Western part, smaller in area but built at a higher elevation) and lower cities (larger in area): both walled. The citadel of Harappan provides ingredients to the modern day social structure.
7. Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of **Shortughai in Afghanistan**
8. Extraordinary uniformity in patterns of seals, crafts and pottery.

## Evidence of authority
- Uniformity in artifacts, seals, weights and bricks.
- Settlements in strategic locations. 
- Labour was mobilized. 
- "Priest King" figure.
- Presence of citadel. Citadel had Great bath, warehouses and granaries.
- Planned settlements.
## Harappan Cities/Sites
### Dholavira
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Dholavira and Ramappa temple in Telangana added to the  UNESCO World Heritage list in 2021. 

</div></div>

- It is the first site of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) in India to get the tag.
- After Mohen-jo-Daro, Ganweriwala, and Harappa in Pakistan and Rakhigarhi in Haryana of India, **Dholavira is the fifth largest metropolis of IVC.**
- The site has a fortified citadel, a middle town, and a lower town with walls made of sandstone or limestone instead of mud bricks in many other Harappan sites.
- **Dholavira has one of the world’s earliest water conservation systems ever excavated.**
	- Satellite pictures show a **reservoir underground**, an expertly constructed rainwater harvesting system extending from the walls of the city, without which the settlement would not have thrived in the sparse rainfall of the desert.
- Multi layered defensive mechanisms
- Special burial site

# Agriculture in IVC
>The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) stands as one of the most remarkable ancient civilizations in history, thriving around 2600 to 1900 BCE in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent. Among its many achievements, the IVC was at the forefront of agricultural innovation, introducing practices that continue to influence modern farming. #introduction 
- The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was the first civilization to produce cotton.
- They practiced agriculture and domesticated cattle, dogs, and cats.
- Evidences of ploughed fields have been found in Kalibangan, and terracotta models of ploughs have been discovered in Banawali.
- The crops cultivated in the IVC included wheat, barley, peas, and rice. Historians suggest that multicropping was practiced, indicating advanced agricultural techniques.
- For water storage, the IVC used gabarbands or Nala's.
- Surplus food was stored in granaries. Notably, the granary at Harappa was more advanced compared to the one found at Mohen-jo-Daro.
    - The Harappa granary featured two rows of six rooms each, with a brick-lined walkway in the middle.
    - The rooms were separated from each other through air ducts, providing safety against flooding and pest attacks.
- The IVC's agricultural success can be attributed to their sophisticated urban planning, efficient water management, and well-designed irrigation systems.
	- The efficient water management and irrigation systems of the Indus Valley Civilization allowed them to cope with periods of low rainfall, ensuring a stable food supply for their growing urban centers.
- Archaeological evidence suggests that the IVC might have also cultivated various other crops, including sesame, mustard, and sugarcane.
- The use of manure and organic waste as fertilizers played a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
- The existence of extensive trade networks facilitated the exchange of agricultural products, leading to economic growth and cultural exchange.

>The IVC's agricultural practices laid the foundation for future civilizations in the Indian subcontinent. #conclusion

# Trade and Commerce in IVC
- The Harappans carried on a considerable trade in stone, metal, shell, etc., within the Indus culture zone. However, the cities did not possess basic raw materials for the commodities they produced. In return for finished goods and possibly food grains, they procured metals from the neighboring areas by boats and bullock carts.
- They followed Barter system, indicated by absence of coins.
	- Weights and measures (16 was unit of measure). 
- Bead making existed in Chanhaduro. 
- The Indus valley people set up trading colonies to facilitate long distance trade. For example, they had set up a trading colony in northern Afghanistan which evidently facilitated trade with Central Asia.
- The trade of lapis lazuli, cotton and other export and import commodities with Mesopotamia, Sumerian can be considered as the origin of modern day long distance commerce. 
## Contact with other civilizations
- Copper coming from a region called Magan (Oman).
- Harappan jars and seals found in Oman.
- Harappan motifs on Cylindrical Mesopotamian seals (e.g. bulls).
- Harappan weights and measurements at Dilmun - Island of Bahrain.
- Mesopotamian text mentions about trade with **Meluha** - Harappans. (Announcement of Sargon of Akkad)
- More than 2 dozen Harappan seals discovered from Mesopotamian cities like Ur.
- Their usage of seals and stamps on traded objects to indicate the place of origin and to protect them from tampering is similar to present day practice of encryption and coding.

# Art and Crafts of IVC
- Potter's wheel. Red and black pottery.
- Seal engravings, especially those with animals. Red Torso is impressive for its realism.
- Bronze figures were cast using "Lost wax technique" 
	- Bronze image of famous dancing girl (Mohen-jo-Daro). 		- Lot of ornaments like bangles
		- Hair tied in bund
		- Standing in a unique posture - Tribhanga
- Stone statue of Bearded man or the Priest King (Mohen-jo-Daro)
	- Eyes were half closed as if meditating.
- The use of carpentry and pottery in Harappan civilisation gives similarity to modern day use of decoration, amulet, etc.
- Bead making was common.
- ==Absence of spoke wheels.==
- Seals were made of terracotta, soapstone etc. with some inscriptions.
- Pasupati seal - aka proto Shiva
	- Similar to Mahayogi posture and Trimukha posture of Hinduism.
- Terracotta figure of Mother Goddess: Indicates presence of fertility cult.
- Harappan stone work was no match for the Egyptian stone work.

# Spiritual and religious life of Harappans
- No evidence of an established religion. No temples found.
	- They practiced idolatry. Pashupati Shiva, Mother Goddesses and Priest King.
	- Phallus (lingam) and Yoni worship. (fertility cult)
	- Trees, stones and animals were worshiped - Animism.
- Great bath at Mohenjodaro.(on the banks of Indus river) 
	- The strong belief of sanctity of water by Harappan’s resembles to the belief of south Indians who keep water tank in temples is a cultural input to modern day civilization. 
- Seals having ritual scenes. One horned rhinoceros - unicorn. 
- Fire altars at Lothal and Kalibangan.
- Burials : Recently discovered Brick-lined burials (as opposed to plain pits) in Rakhigarhi were among the most elaborately constructed graves, and possibly implied a high social or ritual status.
- A new school of thought suggest that diverse religious practices co-existed. Because only small number of burials had been found. Rest might had cremated their body or disposed it in rivers.
- ==Overall a secular way of life==.
- No evidence of varna system or discrimination towards women.
- In general lack of evidences shows that IVC people had no institutionalised religion in modern sense.

>Terracotta figurines and seals throw some light on the religious practices followed by Harappans. Discuss. #MPQ 

</div></div>

## Elements of continuity from IVC
>The ancient civilization in the Indian sub-continent differed from those of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece in that its culture and traditions have been preserved without a breakdown to the present day. Comment. 
 (  #PYMQ/anc/ivc #PYMQ/anc/vedicage  #2015/200/12)


- Worshipping of pipal tree, animals
- Lost wax technique in Art, pottery making
- Multiples of 16 used in weights and measurements.
- Religious tolerance - unity in diversity.
- Cleanliness and health - presence of drainage system.
- Cotton, wheat and rice cultivation
- Great bath - ritualistic bath 
- Fire sacrifices - fire altar
- Tribhanga - posture - in dance forms like Bharata Natyam, Kucchhippudi.

# Decline of IVC

- Major decrease in the strength of [[Monsoon\|Monsoon]]
- [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] shifted the centre of gravity of Indian history. 
	- Decline of urban settlements and evidence of migration to east and south to rural areas.
	- According to a research conducted, about 2000 BCE, there was a rise in aridity in USA, Australia and India.
	- As a result people might have totally depended on river Ghaggar-Hakra.
- Tectonics movement followed by flood.
- over grazing resulting in degradation of soil.
- Saraswati river dried out.
- Aryan Invasion theory by Sir Mortimer Wheeler - discarded. (only talks Mohen-jo-Daro)

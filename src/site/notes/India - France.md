# India-France
India and France have cultivated a robust and enduring bilateral relationship since establishing diplomatic ties in 1947. In 2022, the two nations celebrated 25 years of their Strategic Partnership, launching the **Horizon 2047** framework to guide future cooperation across various sectors, including defense, energy, space, and environmental sustainability.

### Key Areas of Cooperation

1. **Defense**: France is a vital defense partner for India, being the second-largest supplier of military equipment. Major defense deals include the acquisition of Rafale fighter jets and P-75 Scorpene submarines. Joint military exercises like Exercise Shakti (Army), Exercise Varuna (Navy), and Exercise Garuda (Air Force) enhance interoperability between their armed forces.
    
2. **Nuclear and Renewable Energy**: The **India-France Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement (2008)** facilitates collaboration in nuclear energy, with France supplying a significant amount of nuclear fuel to India. Both countries are also co-founders of the **International Solar Alliance (ISA)**, working together to promote solar energy initiatives globally.
    
3. **Space Cooperation**: France supports India's space exploration efforts, particularly the Gaganyaan human spaceflight program. The **Indo-French Centre for Aerospace Research and Innovation (IFCAR)** focuses on research and development in aerospace technologies.
    
4. **Trade and Economy**: Bilateral trade reached $13.4 billion in 2022-23, with France ranking as the 11th largest foreign investor in India. The recent launch of India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in France is a milestone in their economic ties.
    

### Horizon 2047 Framework

- **Visa Facilitation**: A key feature is the introduction of a five-year Schengen visa, simplifying travel between India and France.
- **Sustainability Initiatives**: France supports India’s **CITIIS 2.0 program**, promoting sustainable urban development, and both countries collaborate to eliminate single-use plastics and combat climate change.

### Cultural and Educational Ties

France hosts a significant Indian diaspora, particularly in Réunion Island, fostering cultural and historical connections. Educationally, France aims to attract 30,000 Indian students annually, which enhances people-to-people ties.

The Horizon 2047 framework provides a comprehensive roadmap for the continued deepening of the strategic partnership between India and France. Both nations are committed to addressing global challenges, ensuring peace and stability, and promoting sustainable development

	- Article 37 holds that the DPs shall not be enforceable by any court, but these principles are never-the-less fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the state to apply these principles in making laws. 

</div></div>

- In the Chapakam Dorai Rajan vs State of Madras #case, 1951, the SC held that, the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\|fundamental right]]s (FRs) are superior to the DPs
- In the Kerala Education Bill #case, 1957, SC introduced [[Important Constitutional doctrines#Doctrine of Harmonious Construction\|Doctrine of Harmonious Construction ]]
	- Supreme Court in the Re Kerala Education Bill (1957) had propounded the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to avoid a situation of conflict while enforcing DPSPs and the Fundamental Rights. As per this doctrine, the court held that there is no inherent conflict between FRs and DPSPs and the courts while interpreting a law should attempt to give effect to both as far as possible i. e. should try to harmonize the two as far as possible.
	- The court further said that where two interpretation of the law is possible, and one interpretation validates the law while other interpretation makes the law unconstitutional and void, then the first interpretation which validates the law should be adopted. But if only one interpretation is possible which leads to conflict between DPSPs and FRs, the court has no option but to implement FRs in preference to DPSPs.
- Golaknath #case, 1967:
	- The Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament cannot take away or abridge any of the Fundamental Rights, which are ‘sacrosanct’ in nature.
	- The Court held that the Fundamental Rights cannot be amended for the implementation of the Directive Principles.
- 24th and 25th constitutional amendment Acts:
	- The Parliament reacted to the Supreme Court’s judgement in the Golaknath Case (1967) by enacting the 24th Amendment Act (1971) and the 25th Amendment Act (1971).
	- The 24th Amendment Act declared that the Parliament has the power to abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights by enacting Constitutional Amendment Acts.
	- The 25th Amendment Act inserted a new Article 31C which contained the following two provisions:
		- No law which seeks to implement the socialistic Directive Principles specified in Article 39 (b) and (c) shall be void on the ground of contravention of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Article 14 (equality before law and equal protection of laws), Article 19 (protection of six rights in respect of speech, assembly, movement, etc.) or Article 31 (right to property).
		- No law containing a declaration for giving effect to such policy shall be questioned in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such a policy.
- Kesavananda Bharati #case (1973):
	- The Supreme Court declared that the first provision of Article 31C was held to be constitutional and valid. Thus, the court upheld the position of legal supremacy to the Directive Principles under Article 39(b) and (c) over the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 31.
	- However, the court declared the second provision of Article 31C as unconstitutional and invalid on the ground that judicial review is a basic feature of the Constitution and hence, cannot be taken away. 
	- Propounded The [[Important Constitutional doctrines#Doctrine of Basic Structure\|doctrine of Basic Structure ]] to limit the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution.
	- The Supreme Court has held that it can strike down any law which is included in the Ninth Schedule, if, in its opinion, the law violates the basic structure of the Constitution and if it was inserted after April 24, 1973 (the day the Kesavananda Bharati judgment was delivered.)
- The 42nd Amendment Act (1976):
	- It extended the first provision of Article 31C by including within its protection any law to implement any of the Directive Principles and not merely those specified in Article 39 (b) and (c).
- 44th Constitutional Amendment Act (1978):
	- Article 31 (Right to Property was abolished)
- In the Minerva Mills #case (1980), the [[Supreme Court\|Supreme Court]] held that 'the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CONSTITUTION BOC\|Indian Constitution]] is founded on the bedrock of balance between the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\|FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS]] and the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY\|DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY]]'. The court held that there is no inherent conflict between Part III and [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY\|Part IV]] of the Constitution. And both are complementary and supplementary to each other. They are the two wheels of the same chariot, one aims to achieve socio-economic justice and the other political democracy. The court further held that the balance between FRs and DPs is a part of the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/BASIC STRUCTURE\|BASIC STRUCTURE]] of the Constitution.
- **Current Position**: The Fundamental Rights enjoy supremacy over the Directive Principles. Yet, this does not mean that the Directive Principles cannot be implemented. The Parliament can amend the Fundamental Rights for implementing the Directive Principles, so long as the amendment does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution.

## Importance of DPSPs
- Dr. B R Ambedkar had pointed out that the Directives have great value because they lay down that the goal of Indian polity is ‘economic democracy’ as distinguished from ‘political democracy’.
- They are like an ‘Instrument of Instructions’ or general recommendations addressed to all authorities in the Indian Union. They remind them of the basic principles of the new social and economic order, which the Constitution aims at building.
- They have served as useful beacon-lights to the courts. They have helped the courts in exercising their power of judicial review, that is, the power to determine the constitutional validity of a law.
- They form the dominating background to all State action, legislative or executive and also a guide to the courts in some respects.
- They amplify the Preamble, which solemnly resolves to secure to all citizens of India justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.
- They facilitate stability and continuity in domestic and foreign policies in political, economic and social spheres in spite of the changes of the party in power.
- They are supplementary to the fundamental rights of the citizens and create a favourable atmosphere for the full and proper enjoyment of the fundamental rights by the citizens. They are intended to fill in the vacuum in Part III by providing for social and economic rights. Political democracy, without economic democracy, has no meaning.
- They enable the opposition to exercise influence and control over the operations of the government. The Opposition can blame the ruling party on the ground that its activities are opposed to the Directives.
- They serve as a crucial test for the performance of the government. The people can examine the policies and programmes of the government in the light of these constitutional declarations.
- They serve as common political manifesto.

## Criticisms on the DPSPs
- **Non-Justiciable nature**
- **Constitutional Conflict**: K Santhanam #committee has pointed out that the Directives lead to a constitutional conflict (a) between the Centre and the states, (b) between the President and the Prime Minister, and(c) between the governor and the chief minister on the ground of Compliance of the directives.
- **Illogically Arranged**: The declaration mixes up relatively unimportant issues with the most vital economic and social questions. It combines rather incongruously the modern with the old and provisions suggested by the reason and science with provisions based purely on sentiment and [[Prejudice\|prejudice]].
- **Conditionality**: The implementation of directives is conditional on State’s resources.
- **Conservative elements**: e.g. Prohibition.

## DIRECTIVES OUTSIDE PART IV
Apart from the Directives included in Part IV, there are some other Directives contained in other Parts of the Constitution. They are:
- **Claims of SCs and STs to Services:** The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or a State (**Article 335 in Part XVI**).
- **Instruction in mother tongue:** It shall be the endeavour of every state and every local authority within the state to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother-tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups (**Article 350-A in Part XVII**).
- **Development of the Hindi Language:** It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language and to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India (**Article 351 in Part XVII**).

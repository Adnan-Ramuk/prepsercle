# INDIA AND IT'S NEIGHBORHOOD 
>What geopolitical and economic advantages are enjoyed by India due to its location in the southern part of the Continent of Asia? #PYMQ 1989
- Geographically, the neighbourhood is typically a country’s first point of diplomacy. 
- India’s relationship with its neighbouring countries (NCs) - [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/India-Nepal\|India-Nepal]], [[India-Bhutan\|India-Bhutan]], [[India-Myanmar\|India-Myanmar]], [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/India-Bangladesh\|India-Bangladesh]], [[India-Sri Lanka\|India-Sri Lanka]], [[India-Maldives\|India-Maldives]], [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/India-Pakistan\|India-Pakistan]], [[India-Afghanistan\|India-Afghanistan]], [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/India-China\|India-China]] has similarly been key to its foreign policy. 
- This is certainly true of the past decade (2010-2020), especially since 2014, when the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government first enunciated its [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/BASICS OF FOREIGN POLICY#Neighborhood first\|‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy (NFP)]], and the PM made a record number of visits (16) to neighbouring capitals between 2014-2020. 
- This extensive outreach must be seen in the context of New Delhi’s renewed engagement with the concept of vishwaguru for which regional primacy is a prerequisite and China’s rise both globally and within the subcontinent.
- India's traditional primacy in the neighborhood was built on a mix of material aid, political influence and historical ties.
- Classical geopolitics should be brought on par with health diplomacy, environmental concerns and regional connectivity in South Asia.

## Domestic Irritants in India’s Neighbourhood First Policy
- India’s domestic politics play an important role in its external relations, especially with neighbours. 
	- While this trend has been visibly stronger in the past few years.
		- For example, the Teesta water-sharing agreement, which has been in limbo for years now, was on the brink of resolution in 2011. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee pulled out at the last minute, just before PM Singh was to sign the agreement in Dhaka. 
		- In 2013, Singh didn’t participate in the Colombo Commonwealth Summit because of opposition from the then Tamil Nadu government and Congress party members from the state.
- Still, in 2014-2020, the impact of domestic decision-making on India’s neighbourhood foreign policy definitely became more emphatic. For example new governments' key decisions such as on Article 370, publication of the new map of India, and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).
	- The abrogation of Article 370 further dented an already tense India-Pakistan relationship. This decision was accompanied by the division of India’s Jammu & Kashmir into two new union territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, followed by the publication of a new map. 
	- The map incorporated some territories in dispute with Nepal within India's borders, thus causing a stir in ties with Kathmandu. 
	- The passage of CAA in December 2019 and the government's plan to follow it up with updates to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) concerned Bangladesh. Dhaka feared that a combination of the CAA and NRC could lead to an influx of refugees from India, at a time when it was already hosting nearly a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Dhaka’s displeasure was demonstrated not only through several non-verbal gestures but also verbally, by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who called the Act “unnecessary” even while noting that it was India’s internal matter.
## Beijing’s Rise
- China’s journey towards becoming a global power has carved it a solid path via India’s neighbourhood, providing Beijing more heft, often at India’s expense.
- China and India’s trade numbers with the NCs give some context on the capacity and capability divide between the two. As per the World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) data (available till 2018), India’s trade volume with the NCs grew from US$ 13.45 billion in 2008 to US$ 30.96 in 2018-an approximate rise of 130 per cent. China’s trade volume with the NCs grew at approximately 262 per cent between 2008 (US$ 16.58 billion) and 2018 (US$ 59.99 billion). 
- According to a study by Brookings India, Indian and Chinese trade volumes numbers with South Asia were at similar levels until 2005. Since then, however, Beijing’s trade interactions have consistently been on the rise, barring a slight dip in 2009 due to the global financial crisis unlike New Delhi’s fluctuating numbers. 
- Pakistan’s strong economic ties with China, in particular, have been an important driver of the widening gap between New Delhi and Beijing’s overall trade volumes with South Asia.

## Way Forward
- India and China’s continued jousting for space and influence present opportunities to seek better gains for countries in the neighbourhood. 
- For the NCs, dealing with China is likely to be a one-way street with limited scope for mutual cooperation. 
- In this scenario, India has a chance to offer a more collaborative diplomatic framework that acts as a catalyst for an open and interconnected region. 
- If New Delhi is able to steer away from one-upmanship with Beijing and focus on strengthening its own economic and political capacity, including its ability to engage with the neighbourhood, we may see more constructive India-China competition that would be to the NCs’ benefit. 
- Further, sharpening its ability to deliver could lead to India becoming a preferred partner for the NCs. India’s NFP and the Act East Policy could also witness a merger through a natural common link like [[BIMSTEC\|BIMSTEC]], which is already an emerging focal point of New Delhi’s regional outreach.
- A more deliberate and proactive Indian approach towards an inter-connected neighbourhood would automatically pose a legitimate counter to China, although without the latter’s capital heft. 
- Further, since the negative foreign policy impacts of domestic Indian decision-making are only likely to rise, a proactive outlook towards the neighbourhood could create a cushion for future diplomatic friction.

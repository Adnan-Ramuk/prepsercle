# INDIA AND THE WORLD - MULTILATERAL
>"We live in an inter-dependent world. An isolated India is not in our interest" - Narendra Modi

Free and Open Indo-Pacific - FOIP
Regions like [[Indo-Pacific\|Indo-Pacific]] and Eurasia are the new power centres in international politics.

Middle powers like India, Turkey, Japan, Australia are leaning towards USA or China as per their interests. 
India can act as a bridge between Indo-Pacific and Eurasian Power blocks.

There could be many power centres in the new world order and India should opt for multi-engagement (not multi-alignment as some experts have suggested) for a multipolar world. Instead of being sucked into any bloc, it should aim to create new pillars of the new order by engagement and partnership with middle powers.

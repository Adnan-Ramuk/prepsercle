![Pasted image 20220407173822.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220407173822.png)
## Historical background of India - Pakistan relations
- Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947, the Kashmir conflict, and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations.
- Consequently, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion. 
- Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in certain demographics ("Indo-Aryan peoples") and shared lingua francas (mainly Punjabi, Sindhi, and Hindustani).
- Soon after gaining their independence, India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations, but the violent partition and reciprocal territorial claims quickly overshadowed their relationship. Since their independence, the two countries have fought three major wars (in 1947, [[Wars fought by India#1965 war with Pakistan\|1965]] and the [[Wars fought by India#Bangladesh war of liberation -1971\|Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971]]), as well as one undeclared war ([[Wars fought by India#Kargil conflict\|Kargil war in 1999]]), and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. 
- **The Karachi agreement of 1949** with [[United Nations Organisation (UNO)\|UN]] as a third party is the first ceasefire agreement between these two rivals. This agreement created a boundary in Kashmir called the **Ceasefire Line or CFL**. UNMOGIP was mandated to monitor the ceasefire along the CFL.
- **The Suchetgarh Agreement of 1972** (Shimla Agreement) renamed CFL as the LoC or **Line of Control**. This smart move made the UNMOGIP presence in Kashmir Irrelevant. Since UN was not a party to **Shimla Agreement** unlike Karachi Agreement.
-  During 1998 both India and Pakistan successfully tested their nuclear weapon capabilities.
- In 2001 the attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad was the last event of this phase of active aggression between the two countries. 
- Signed the **Agreement on Consular access** in 2008. Hundreds of Indian fishermen in Pakistan's prisons often denied of Consular access. 
- While both nations have held a shaky cease-fire agreement since 2003, they continue to trade fire across the disputed area. Both nations blame the other for breaking the cease-fire agreement, claiming that they are firing in retaliation for attacks. 
- On both sides of the disputed border, an increase in territorial skirmishes that started in late 2016 and escalated into 2018 killed hundreds of civilians and made thousand homeless.
- Pakistani singers, musicians, comedians and entertainers have enjoyed widespread popularity in India, with many achieving overnight fame in the Indian film industry Bollywood. Likewise, Indian music and film are very popular in Pakistan.
### Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear installations
- It is a bilateral agreement signed on 31st December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, between India and Pakistan by then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his Pakistani counterpart Benazir Bhutto.
- Under it, both countries inform each other about their nuclear installations and facilities that need to be covered under the Agreement on 1 January every year.
	- This is an annual exchange to prevent them from attacking each other’s nuclear facilities. The exchange is part of an agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbors meant to prevent attacks on nuclear facilities by each other.
- It bars them from carrying out any surprise attack (or to assist foreign power to attack) on each other’s nuclear installations and facilities.
- India and Pakistan have recently exchanged a list of their nuclear installations and facilities with each other under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear installations. This is the 27th consecutive exchange of such a list between two countries after the first list was exchanged on 1 January 1992.
## Recent developments
- China and Pakistan signed the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructural project in 2015 which was an affront to Indian sovereignty as the corridor passes through the PoK.
- Bilateral relations were dented by the series of attacks which started with Gurdaspur terror attacks in 2015 and included other major incidents like the Pathankot attack (2016), Nagrota attack (2016), Uri attack (2016), Amarnath yatra attack (2017) and finally the Pulwama attack in 2019.
- India responded to the Uri attack by carrying out a ‘surgical strike’ inside PoK and to the Pulwama attack by carrying out the Balakot airstrike in Pakistan and revoking the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan.
- Following the abrogation of Article 370 the diplomatic relations between the two countries have been downgraded. Pakistan launched a global diplomatic campaign to attract international support for Pakistan’s position on Kashmir.
- 2021 Ceasefire agreement after registering a highest ceasefire violation in 18 years (with 5130 cases) in 2020 is a significant military measure. Also a recognition of the fact that both countries cannot afford to let violence spiral out of control.
	- [[backchannel dipolomacy\|backchannel dipolomacy]] facilitated by the UAE led to the announcement of ceasefire on the LoC.
- The two sides do not have high commissioners on the other side, there is no structured bilateral dialogue, have not held 'Expert Level Talks on Nuclear Confidence Building Measure' or 'Expert Level Talks on Conventional Confidence Building Measures' for several years now.
- Pakistan is gradually drifting toward a new strategic alignment with Russia and China.
## Impact of India - Pakistan tensions on regional development
- India - Pakistan animosity hurts regionalism and south Asian growth.
- The **supremacy of politics over trade and economy** is a curse in South Asia, particularly in India-Pak relations.
- Intra-regional trade- accounts for a little more than 5 percent of South Asia’s total trade while it accounts for 50 percent of total trade in East Asia and the Pacific and 22 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. SAARC and SAFTA are also ineffective due to the conflictual relations between two.
- SAARC has remained as a victim of India - Pakistan posturing.

## Irritants
- Kashmir conundrum: The tug of war over Kashmir represented the contest between identities of two nations. While Pakistan tries to alter status quo in Kashmir by force, India is content to retain its portion of Kashmir, without making serious efforts to change the situation on the ground.
### Internal security threats from Pakistan
- The internal security problems have become aggravated in recent times with **Pakistan’s policy of cross border terrorism**, along with its intense hostile anti-India propaganda designed to mislead and sway the loyalties of border population.
	>Terrorism: Source in Pakistan and Afghanistan. #PYMQ 2006
	
- Pakistan fuels terrorist activities into India based on the military doctrine of ‘bleeding India with a thousand cuts’ through these separate and scattered terror events. 
- The offensive agenda of Pakistan’s ISI to promote international terrorism and subvert India is expected to intensify. 
	- The J&K cauldron is expected to continue. 
	- Vigorous efforts are on to revive militancy in Punjab. 
	- Insurgent groups in different parts of the country are receiving support and encouragement. 
	- Illegal infiltration and smuggling of arms and explosives, narcotics and counterfeit currency are pressing problems.
- **Samjhauta Express** is being used for gunrunning and drug trafficking. 
	- Adequate arrangements are needed to ensure foolproof security checks, in respect of buses that ply between India and Pakistan.
- The guarding of the coastal and creek areas of Gujarat pose extreme challenges due to the hostile terrain, inhospitable climatic conditions, hazardous nature of the sea and creek areas on this side of the border, the existence of about 400 sq. kms of mangrove swamp with interlacing intricate stretches of sub-creeks and deep inlets of varying dimensions and further complicated by the ever shifting sand bars. 
	- The resources presently available to the BSF, Police and the Customs are inadequate to meet these challenges in coastal and creek areas.
	- It is quite possible that Pakistan may use the Gujarat route to push Bangladeshi nationals to India.

### Trade
- The size of India-Pakistan trade is very small relative to the size of their economies and the fact that they share a contiguous border.Trade across direct routes has been curtailed formally, so the bulk of India-Pakistan trade is routed through Dubai.
- The trade between two enemy countries has been far lower that its potential (around $2 billion in 2018-19) due to complicated and non-transparent non-tariff and tariff measures. Without artificial barriers, this should be $37 billion. Cross-border trade usually follows the cycles of terrorist events showing ups and downs. 
- India withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status of Pakistan after Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, which it had granted to Pakistan in 1996.
	- For the textile and Sugar industries in Pakistan, importing from India is imperative practical and is the most economic.
	- India also increased the custom duty to 200% which affected the trade of Pakistani apparel and cement.

### Water sharing
- As a response to the Pakistan based cross-border terrorism India has repeatedly called for abrogation of the Indus water distribution mechanism citing that blood and water cannot flow together. 
- In the wake of the Uri attack, Delhi suspended the bi-annual water talks and promised to ‘fast-track’ projects to use hitherto unutilised water of the eastern rivers allocated to India via three national projects (the multipurpose Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams, and the Beas-Sutlej river-linking project.)
#### Indus Water Treaty (IWT)
- The Indus Waters Treaty governs the rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Signed in 1960, with World Bank as a mediator.
- It allocated the three western rivers - Indus, Chenab and Jhelum to Pakistan for unrestricted use, barring certain non-consumptive, agricultural and domestic uses by India and the three Eastern rivers—Ravi, Beas and Sutlej—were allocated to India for unrestricted usage. (80% of the share of water went to Pakistan, while leaving the rest 20% of water for use by India)
- According to the provisions of the IWT, the Permanent Indus Commission is required to meet at least once a year.
- Pakistan had raised concerns over likely impact of India’s Kishanganga (Jhelum) and Ratle (Chenab) hydroelectric projects - both in J&K on supply of water to Pakistan.
- Water is cited as one possible cause for a conflict between the two nations, but to date issues such as the Nimoo Bazgo Project have been resolved through diplomacy.
- The situation today is far different to that prevalent fifty years back when the Indus Water treaty was signed.’ Highlight the complexity of the current challenges on both sides of the border in this regard. Do you think that a review of the Treaty is in India’s best interests? #PYMQ 2012.
- Present an account of the Indus Water Treaty and examine its ecological, economic and political implications in the context of changing bilateral relations. (2016)

### Other issues
- Capture of fishermen
- Drug smuggling from the Golden Crescent,
- Fake Indian currencies sneaking through the western borders.
- Boundary dispute: Apart from Kashmir, India and Pakistan have not been able to come to terms on the exact boundary between the two nations in the north (along the LoC) and in the West (Sir Creek issue).
## Way forward
- Normalcy in Kashmir: India should concentrate on restoring normalcy in Jammu & Kashmir, mainstreaming the population, especially the youth, encourage investment in the state. Allaying minority fears in India through informed approach on issues like the NRC, CAA would unarm Pakistan at international forums. 
- People-to-people contacts: At the ground level public opinion in both countries could be moulded through entertainment channels, media and music. Further cricket diplomacy can play a vital role in boosting such relations.
	- >Terrorist activities and mutual distrust have clouded India-Pakistan relations. To what extent the use of soft power like sports and cultural exchanges could help generate goodwill between the two countries? Discuss with suitable examples. #PYMQ 2015
- Trade facilitation: Pakistan is undergoing severe economic crisis and is on the verge of receiving further international sanctions (FATF grey list). At this juncture, easing bilateral trade restrictions and facilitation of cross border trade could address the trust deficit between two countries. 
- Terror and talks cannot go together.
- Our relationship with Pakistan should be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be.
- India and Pakistan must ensure that fishermen are not victims of deterioration in ties. 
- Both countries should consider setting up mechanisms such as Nuclear Risk Reduction Centres (NRRCs), established between the US and USSR during [[Cold War\|Cold War]].

> India should pursue policy of both containment and negotiation. The best that can happen on the India-Pakistan front is that diplomatic relations are restored fully, trade opens up and there is some easing up on travel. #conclusion

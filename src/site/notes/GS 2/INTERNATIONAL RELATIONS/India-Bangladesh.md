	- China agreed to fund about $1 billion for "**Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project**"
	- While India did put the river Teesta on the bilateral discussion table, the federal political dynamics has prevented the Centre from resolving the issue of water-sharing overruling Bengal’s position. Mamata Banerjee (CM of West Bengal) is of the view that with Bangladesh having its largest irrigation project, the Teesta Barrage, running, they do not deserve more water.
- National Register of Citizens (NRC) 
- China is making inroads to South Asia. Its cheque-book diplomacy is well entrenched in South Asia. Bangladesh’s largest defence partner is China.
- Farakka dam dispute.
- Issues of illegal migration.
- Ethnic issues faced by Hindu minority in Bangladesh.
- Chakma hajong - NRC already more than 1.5 cr Bangladeshi migrants.
- Drugs and Cattle smuggling through the border.
- Terrorist infiltration through border.
- Dumping of Fake Indian Currency Notes, recently several duplicate notes have been found along the border, which cripple the Indian Economy severely.

## Way Forward
- Both countries should need to continue working on the three Cs - cooperation, collaboration and consolidation.
- 3T’s – Tackling Terrorism + Trade and Transit + Teesta treaty
- Agreement on water sharing should be given priority. Early resolution of the Teesta issue is necessary.
- Focus on [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/BASICS OF FOREIGN POLICY#soft power\|soft power]]

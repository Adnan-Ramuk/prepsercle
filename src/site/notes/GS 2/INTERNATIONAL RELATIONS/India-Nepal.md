## CHALLENGES
- India's big brother attitude
	- There is a widespread perception in Nepal that India does not respect the country’s sovereignty and that it often intervenes in Nepal’s domestic affairs.
	- Nepal accused India of imposing an economic blockade including blockade of gas supply, fuel etc. on them to put pressure to make certain amendments in their constitution.
	- There was much outrage in Nepal of the way Indian media covered the 2015 Nepal Earthquake rescue and relief operations. Many in Nepal, trended hashtags like #gobackIndia on social media to express their outrage.
- China factor
	- Nepal’s growing proximity to China. Nepal often plays China card as an attempt to balance the overwhelming presence of India. 
	- OBOR ([[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|BRI]]) - **China-Nepal Economic Corridor**.
	- China plans to extend the Tibet railway to Kathmandu across the border in the next few years.
	- Communication projects 
	- Dams built by China.
- Border issues
	- Porous border 
		- illegal migration, human trafficking, cattle trafficking.
		- Indo Nepal border is used as launch pad by Maoist, terrorist and drug traffickers.
	- Kalapani territorial dispute (India– China-Nepal tri-junction + Treaty of Saigauli 1816)) and dispute at Susta. 
	- Recent Map controversy: Nepal claims land in the region of Lipu Lekh pass.
	- Fluctuating borders due to change in river course. The Kosi treaty of 1954.
- Issues of Madhesi community in Terai region. (Madhesi population has familial & ethnic ties with states of Bihar, UP. Thus, any mishap on either side has significant political repercussions.)
	- The new constitution of 2015 gave representation to Madhesis which was not in proportion to their population.
	- It also made obtaining citizenship by Madhesi's exceedingly difficult and discriminating.
	- India has objected to these discriminatory provisions and requested Nepal to rectify them.
- India-Nepal friendship treaty obliged Nepal to inform India and seek its consent for the purchases of military hardware from third countries. Nepal wants to change this provision.
- Delay in implementation of various projects
- Climate change - vulnerability of Himalayan Region
- Internal Security-There is alleged link between Naxalites and Maoist in Nepal.
- Nepal under domestic political chaos, fragile democracy - internal politics is still shaping its foreign policy choices. Authoritarian style of K.P Sharma Oli is a major factor leading to this crisis.

## Recent developments 
- India is building roads in the Terai region, helping Nepal in its post earthquake reconstruction work, building railway lines, a police training academy, a polytechnic college, an oil pipeline and border check posts. The government has allocated Rs 800 crore in this year’s budget for projects in Nepal.
- MOUs have been signed between both the governments for laying an electric rail track linking Kathmandu with Raxaul in India
- Early provision of vaccines. Disrupted after vaccine shortage in India. Now Nepal is depended on US vaccines.
- Infrastructural deals - Petroleum product pipeline  from Siliguri to Jhapa in Nepal
- Cross border rail connectivity projects.
- Recently inaugurated Integrated Check Posts helped in seamless movement of people and trade between two nations.
- Some section of the people want the '**cultural monacrchy**' back to substitute the Presidential system.
- Kalapani territorial dispute
- PM Modi has expressed his readiness to revise and update the 1950 treaty to bring in line with the changing times while keeping in mind the interest of both countries.
- Top level visits are blocked due to #COVID-19  pandemic and diplomatic spat.

## Way forward
- 4C’s- Cooperation, Connectivity, Culture and Constitution.
- PM Modi gave a new “5T” (“Tradition”, “Trade”, “Tourism”, “Technology and Transport”) formula for Indo-Nepal relation.
- India must respect Nepal’s sovereignty; mutual respect is a key in bilateral relations; and India should not meddle in the internal political affairs of Nepal.
- ==Pragmatic than paternalistic approach==
- Our engagement with Nepal tends to be episodic and crisis-driven, and not backed by the human and material resources that our neighbor deserves.
- India should counter Chinese hard power by projecting soft power. In contrast to China’s efforts to muscle its way into Nepal, India should emphasize on its historically close cultural, religious, and people-to-people relations with Nepal and its geographical proximity. China cannot overcome this. Improve implementation of projects.
	- Take environmental perspective
	- Promote tourism
	- Soft power


Nepal must act as a bridge between two rising nations (India and China) and help bring co-operation prosperity and peace in the region. Challenge is keeping a balance between change and continuity.

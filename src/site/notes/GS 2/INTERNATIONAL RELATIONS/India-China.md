- Countries may take an anti-China rhetoric, but will continue to do business with Beijing.
- We are caught in what strategic experts call the “[[Thucydides Trap\|Thucydides Trap]]” - the condition that war is likely if a new power feels threatened by the rise of another. 
- Two buffer states, Tibet was a buffer state.

## Background of India - China relations
- India and China had historically maintained peaceful relations for thousands of years of recorded history.
- The modern relationship began in 1950 when India was among the first countries to end formal ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) and recognise the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of Mainland China.
- Relations between contemporary China and India have been characterised by border disputes, resulting in three military conflicts – the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the border clashes in Nathu La and Cho La in 1967, and the 1987 Sumdorong Chu standoff.
- However, since the late 1980s, both countries have successfully rebuilt diplomatic and economic ties. 
- In 2008, China became India's largest trading partner ( up to 13% of India's total trade) and the two countries have also extended their strategic and military relations.
- In 2012 China stated it's position that "Sino Indian ties" could be the most "important bilateral partnership of the century".
- Since 2013, border disputes have reemerged to take centerstage in the two countries' mutual relations. 
- In early 2018, the two armies got engaged in a standoff at the Doklam plateau along the disputed Bhutan-China border.
- Since summer 2020, armed standoffs and skirmishes at multiple locations along the entire Sino-Indian border escalated. A serious clash occurred in the Galwan Valley resulting in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and some number of Chinese soldiers
- 2020 also marked the 70th anniversary of Indo China diplomatic ties.
## Recent developments
- Mamallapuram - informal summit
- China recently passed a law which explicitly allows it coast guard to fire on foreign vessels raises concern.
- China's Fourteenth Five Year Plan emphasises a $1.4 trillion strategy for the development of Science and Technology. 
- Bloody incident at Galwan on June 15th, 2020.
- The government has banned 59 apps of Chinese origin citing the “emergent nature of threats” from mobile applications.
- India excluded, Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE in 5G trails. We cannot have bloodshed on border, good relationship in other domains : External Affairs Minister.

- The Indian government has made its prior approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share land border with India to curb "opportunistic takeovers" of domestic firms - a move which will restrict FDI from China.
- To cut import dependency on China for APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), the Indian government in March, 2020 approved a package comprising four schemes with a total outlay of Rs. 13,760 crore to boost domestic production of bulk drugs and medical devices in the country along with their exports
- [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|BRI]] countries are using Renminbi in financial transactions with China.
- China-South Asia grouping, China led initiative for #COVID-19 vaccines and poverty alleviation.
- New Border Law:
	- China's new law on land borders has come into effect from the new year (2022).
	- The law states among other things that China abides by treaties concluded with or jointly acceded to by foreign countries on land boundary affairs.

### Hong Kong issue
#### Background
- Hong Kong was a British colony till 1997 and handed over to Mainland China under Sino-China joint declaration.
- Since then, it has been ruled under '**one country two systems**' 
- **Basic Law** -  the constitution that governed Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) since 1997 -  gives that the HKSAR is a part of China but enjoys high degree of autonomy and executive, legislative and independent judicial power except in foreign policy and defence.
- It also says socialist system and policies shall not practiced for 50 years.
- The city become a financial hub particularly because of its independent judicial system and liberal polity.
- The recent actions, ever since 2019 pro-democracy protest, taken by Chinese government diminishes HK's democratic system.
	- (security law to curb dissent, new electoral rules in HKSAR, candidate qualification review committee etc.)
China must act in accordance with its legal obligations and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms in HKSAR.
## India - China ties
### Economic ties
- India-China economic relations have been institutionalized through the **Joint Economic Group and Business Council**, as well as more focused efforts such as the "Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation"
- India’s trade with China in 2021 crossed $125 billion with imports from China nearing a record $100 billion, underlining continued demand for a range of Chinese goods, particularly machinery.
	- India’s Biggest Exports to China: India’s biggest exports to China in recent years were iron ore, cotton and other raw material-based commodities, which have seen a recovery in demand in China last year (2021).
	- India’s Biggest Imports from China: India has imported large quantities of electrical and mechanical machinery, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), auto components and, over the past two years, a range of medical supplies from oxygen concentrators to Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs).
- >Do you think that China’s emergence as one of the largest trading partners of India had adversely affected the settlement of the outstanding border problem? #PYMQ 2012
### Military relations
- China and India conduct a joint military exercise called 'Exercise Hand–in–Hand'.
### Regional and Multilateral forums
- [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)\|Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)]]
- [[BRICS\|BRICS]]

- G20
## Challenges and threats
Despite growing economic and strategic ties, there are a lot of hurdles for India and the PRC to overcome.
- Trade imbalance: India faces trade imbalance heavily in favour of China. 
	- The trade deficit for India grew to USD 69.38 billion in 2021.
		- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Trade deficit - Trade deficit refers to a situation where the country's import dues exceed the receipts from the exports.  

</div></div>

	- India has been highlighting its concerns over the growing trade deficit with China for over a decade and calling on China to open its markets for India's IT and pharmaceutical products.
- Border disputes: The two countries failed to resolve their border dispute and Indian media outlets have repeatedly reported Chinese military incursions into Indian territory.
	- Both countries have steadily established military infrastructure along border areas including amidst the 2020 China–India skirmishes.
	- Chinese obsession with Tawang is totally strategic since it will give PLA an entry to Brahmaputra valley.
- China's strong strategic bilateral relations with Pakistan.
- China's funding to the separatist groups in Northeast India.
- China has expressed concerns about Indian military and economic activities in the disputed South China Sea.
- China's defence budget is three to four times that of India's.
- Water discord, meanwhile, is fuelling China-India tensions. In recent years, Beijing increasingly has been employing its water leverage against India.
- China is trying to destroy India's confidence and reduce it into a state of isolation and impotence in global affairs. e.g. Galwan incident.
### China's increasing nuclear capabilities
- According a US report, by 2027 Chinese nuclear arsenal is likely to increase to 700 weapons from current 200.
- Low yield weapons are major concern since they are meant for conventional battlefields to avoid collateral damage.
- Opacity in Chinese military's nuclear development.
- China's move towards a Launch on Warning (LoW) posture marks a shift from China's nuclear doctrine. This would reduce the reaction time for India to retaliate.
### China's assertiveness in India's neighborhood 
- Debt trap diplomacy in the neighborhood. eg Sri Lanka.
- Lhasa-Nyingchi Bullet train links Lhasa to Indian border.
#### China-Pakistan nexus
- Both countries describe their relationship as one of "all weather partners" and "iron brothers"
- China exported most advanced warship to Pakistan - to be deployed in [[Indian Ocean\|Indian Ocean]].
#### China-Russia
- Growing animosity between China and U.S has led both the countries to further cement their relationship to counter USA.
- Both countries are committed to **Greater Eurasian Partnership**, also they agreed to work under **Eurasian Economic Union** sponsored by Russia and China's [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|BRI]].
- Post [[Cold War\|Cold War]], Russia tried to create a strategic triangle with India and China on board.
#### String of Pearls
- It is indicative of the growing geopolitical influence of China in India's neighborhood, through concentrated efforts in the form of modernising the armies, fostering strong economic relations, establishing naval bases, increasing access to air fields etc. 
- e.g. Hambantotta port in Sri Lanka, Gwadar port in Pakistan, Chittagong port in Bangladesh.
	- Construction of Hambantotta port in Sri Lanka and granting observer status to Lanka in [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)\|Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)]] has been interpreted by Indian FP scholars as reflective of wider encirclement by China towards India.
	- Gwadar port is connected to Xinjiang via CPEC. CPEC passes through POK. In POK Pakistan and China entered into a written agreement. This can be read as China's acceptance of sovereignty of Pakistan over POK, which is in reality an Integral part of India.
- China is building military base Tajikistan, India and Russia already have military bases in Tajikistan.

- >Critically examine the security and strategic implications of the so-called 'string of pearls' theory for India. #PYMQ 2011
## Way forward
- India-China relations need a reset now.  India's political and military leadership should learn the right kessibs from Ladakh, to ensure they are better postured to meet the challenge of Chinese coercion.
- To reduce the dependence of Chinese products, India needs to analyze imports from China, and develop the way forward.
- Further, based on the economic complexity model, the Indian government can formulate proper road maps through compartmentalizing them as per technology and innovation capabilities.
- China should open its markets for India's IT and pharmaceutical products.
- Our relationship with China should be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be and adversarial when it must be.
- Peace and tranquility in border areas.
	- Peace is a fundamental prerequisite for the normal conduct of relations.
	- Disengagement at Pangong Tso is a welcome step.
- Mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests is the key to repair India china relations. 2020 was an year of exceptional stress in India-China relations.
	- For India, Pangong Tso is critical to maintain hold on Chushul Valley.
- One cardinal principle of Panchsheel has been equality and mutual benefit, which is opposed to **one-upmanship**. e.g. As China is now a bigger power, it is all the more appropriate that it displays sensitivity and reciprocity in multilateral institutions like the UNSC and the BRICS. 
- It is high time that China goes beyond its stated position that it understands and appreciates India’s aspiration to play greater role in the world, and comes out with clear proposal for UNSC reforms.
- A weak India is not only less attractive as a partner globally, it makes New Delhi more dependent on U.S to deal with China.

Similarly the two countries should work together in concert on issues such as climate change and fighting the menace of terrorism. The new world equilibrium needs to emerge, recognising the global shift of power.

>India, today needs more internationalism that is rooted in realism and tethered to India's economic and national security priorities while dealing with China. #conclusion

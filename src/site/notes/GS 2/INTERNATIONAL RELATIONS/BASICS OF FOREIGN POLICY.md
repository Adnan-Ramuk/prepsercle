# BASICS OF FOREIGN POLICY (FP)
>Foreign policy encompasses the tactics and process by which a nation interact with other nation or a group of nations to further its own interests.

- e.g. during the [[Cold War\|Cold War]] India adopted a foreign policy of not aligning itself with any major power Bloc.
- National interest of a country is dynamic in nature. It changes according to the time and circumstances. Hence FP is also dynamic. 
- In International Relations friends are not permanent, what is permanent is National Interest (NI).
	- Primary NI: Which is meant to protect political, cultural and geographical identity of a state.
	- Secondary NI: It is meant to protect it's citizens abroad.
- Foreign policy does not exist in vacuum. FP develops under certain considerations.
	- Internal security - **Security Dilemma** in the neighborhood. e.g. border conflict with China, China's string of pearls etc.
	- Economic consideration - Trade relations with China.
	- Geographical and historical factors - India's relationship with neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan etc. 
	- Energy security - e.g. India's relationship with gulf countries.
	- Strategic autonomy : India's FP shouldn't be guided by any kind of external pressure.
	- International events - Cold war, #COVID-19 pandemic etc. 
- Foreign Policy (FP) cannot be a part-time concern of the national leadership; in terms of priority and attention it should be on par with domestic affairs.
	- Indian FP has often been ad hoc, reactive and short term, reflecting the absence of a broad strategic culture.
		- e.g. India' refugee policy is guided primarily by adhocism, which of course has its own political utility.
			- India did not sign 1951 Refugee convention and its 1967 protocol mainly because, the West's lopsided obsession with Civil and political rights at the cost of economic rights.

## Geo-politics
- Geopolitics, is the analysis or study of the geographic influences (both human and physical) on power relationships in international relations.
- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much of the geopolitical writings focused on the impact on world politics of the new technologies of the [[INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\|Industrial Revolution]].
	- It sought to understand how the new industrial capabilities of transportation, communication, and destruction-most notably railroads, steamships, airplanes, telegraphy, and explosives-interacting with the largest-scale geographic features of the Earth would shape the character, number, and location of viable security units in the emerging global international system.
- The popularity of geopolitical theory declined after [[World War II\|World War II]], both because of its association with Nazi German and imperial Japanese aggression and because the emergence of nuclear explosives and ballistic missiles reduced the significance of geographical factors in the global strategic balance of power. 
- However, geopolitics continued to influence international politics, serving as the basis for the United States’ [[Cold War\|Cold War]] strategy of containment, which was developed by **George Kennan** as a geopolitical strategy to limit the expansion of the Soviet Union. 
- Political geographers also began to expand geopolitics to include economic as well as military factors.
- In geopolitics, consequences need not necessarily follow the plan of action.
- **IN GEOPOLITICS THE STRONG GET TO BEND AND BREAK THE RULES**.
## Geo-economics
- Geo-economics is the study of how economics functions in an international environment. It is basically an academic study of the global move of capital, market and labour. 
- The concept of geo-economics thereby interacts with the geographic and demographic aspects of states and consequently influences their own policy with regard to international trade and commerce. 
- Geo-economics also provides us with a list of economic powers; the states with the greatest economic strengths, and how that influences the structure of power. For example, the US as the top economy followed by China as the second largest economy, and how the distribution of economic power informs their politics, etc.
## Geo-strategy
- Geo-strategy is the **practical world of policy-making** amongst states at the international level. 
- It basically informs states to chart out a strategic course of which policies to undertake in order to improve ones’ own position in the international order. This could include policies to become the world’s pre-eminent power, or to become an economic power or a regional actor. 
- The geographic location of a country plays a critical role in the formulation of geo-strategy.
## Strategic partnership
- Strategic partnership is a partnership between two states in order to support/forward/craft particular goals in the international order. 
- A strategic partnership enables two states to have a common vision towards a particular foreign policy goal. For example, the US and India have a strategic partnership between them. This strategic partnership brings the two countries together on global issues like safeguard of the [[Global commons\|global commons]], the fight against piracy, non-proliferation, high technology cooperation, etc. 
- The strategic partnership framework also offers the guidelines for future policy making on issues of common interest.
## Balance of power
- Balance of power, in international relations, is the **posture and policy** of a nation or group of nations protecting itself against another nation or group of nations by matching its power against the power of the other side. 
- States can pursue a policy of balance of power in two ways: by increasing their own power, as when engaging in an armaments race or in the competitive acquisition of territory; or by adding to their own power with that of other states, as when embarking upon a policy of alliance.
### Direct opposition
- When a state imposes its will on the other state or a group of states, it is confronted directly by other states. This is referred to as **direct opposition**. e.g. [[Wars fought by India#Bangladesh war of liberation -1971\|Bangladesh war of liberation -1971]]
### Pattern of competition
- When two states compete with each other to establish their control over a third nation or a region, which can be political or economical in nature-it is refereed to as pattern of competition. e.g. India and China competing one another to establish their control over Africa.
## Evolution of India's foreign policy
### 1947-1961- [[Nehruvian Era\|Nehruvian Era]]     
- Domestic factors: Socialism, Mixed economy
- Focus on: South-south cooperation, Anti-[[Imperialism\|Imperialism]], equality of all nations.
- **Panchsheel**
	- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



## Panchsheel
- Panchsheel principles are a set of principles to govern relations between states. These principles were born to ensure a world where nations can co-exist and prosper together in peace and harmony.
- An underlying assumption of the five principles was that newly independent states after decolonisation would be able to develop a new and more principled approach to international relations. The five principles of Panchsheel provide a basis for not only interstate relations but also the construction of a new international order.

### Five principles of Panchsheel
1. Mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.
2. Mutual non-aggression.
3. Mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs.
4. Equality and cooperation for mutual benefit.
5. Peaceful coexistence.
### Relevance of Panchsheel
- Guiding tool in India’s relation with its neighbours. Eg: [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/BASICS OF FOREIGN POLICY#Gujral Doctrine I K Gujral-1996\|Gujral Doctrine]] is based on Panchsheel principles.
- India’s relation with countries are guided by this principle – eg: In Africa, Latin America etc. difference between Indian and Chinese  Intention in these markets.
- India still follow non-alignment principle which is guided by the Panchsheel principles to develop a framework for equitable globalization and genuine multilateralism
- Panchsheel could act as a catalyst to better coordinate efforts, enhance mutual understanding, share developmental experiences and tackle trans-national threats more effectively.

### Why it is not relevant?
- Change of circumstances - emerging threats like Terrorism
- Ideal philosophy which is not practical now. Many violations by other countries. Eg: China violated the Panchsheel principle back in 1962.

### New Panchsheel 
Concept evolved by Manmohan Singh – (not a govt policy though) Replacement of current 5 principles with new 5 principles
1. More emphasis on economic diplomacy – to achieve national interest.
2. Developmental priorities should determine its engagement.
3. Multi alignment from non-alignment
4. Greater importance to regional cooperation
5. Linkages with world’s major economies

# Non Alignment Movement
>The Non-Aligned Movement is a forum of 120 developing world states that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. After the United Nations, it is the largest grouping of states worldwide.

![NAM.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/NAM.jpg)

- After [[World War II\|WW2]] the world was divided into 2 power blocs. Communist (Socialist ) and capitalist.
- India wanted to divert its limited resources for economic development and not for military preparedness alone. So India resisted an entry into a military alliance with the power blocs.
- A non-aligned nation always has the right to express her views on the matters of of international affairs. The term non-alignment is often confused with the terms like isolated state, non-committed state and neutral state.
- Isolated state follows the policy of aloofness on matters of international affairs. Where as a non-committed state follows the policy of attachment in multi-corner conflict.
- A neutral state take neutral stand on international affairs.
- Foundation stones for NAM was laid down in 1947 when Asian relations conference was organized in New Delhi. And in Afro Asia conference organised in Bandung Indonesia in 1955.
- Formally NAM was announced in 1961 when Belgrade conference took place.
- The founding fathers of the Non-Aligned Movement were
	- Josip Broz Tito of Socialist Yugoslavia,
	- Jawaharlal Nehru of India,
	- Sukarno of Indonesia,
	- Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt and
	- Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.

- A nation can be declared as non aligned if the following criteria are met.
	- The nation should have an independent FP
	- It should support independence of others.
	- Shouldn't be a part of multilateral agreement signed in the context of cold war politics.
	- Shouldn't be a part of Bilateral Alliances in the context of cold war politics.

## Relevance of NAM
The significance of NAM during cold war phase was that, NAM countries could resist the power bloc's pressure to join their alliances. By not joining, NAM countries could use that opportunity for their development.

The relevance of NAM is being questioned on account of two main considerations.

1. After the [[Decline of Soviet Union and Emergence of New World Order\|Decline of Soviet Union and Emergence of New World Order]] the relevance of NAM is reduced. The world moved from bipolar to multi polar. Also Change of circumstances - new threats like Terrorism emerging.
2. Theory of complex interdependence of sates says that, " in a world of free trade and market economy, a nation cannot be truly non-aligned, as it has to depend on other nations for its existence."

But justification of the relevance of NAM can be made on the basis of the following reasons.

1. Disarmament: which was an objective of NAM is relevant. Since one cannot say that the world is free from weapons of mass destruction.
2. NAM was setup for the benefit of developing nations as the members of NAM were mainly countries of global south.
3. Some power blocs are still present in the world. e.g. Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which poses threat to international peace.
4. India also follow NAM, because this would remove the fear of any nation with which India enters into a bilateral or a multilateral agreement.
5. The principle of NAM is in accordance with India's principle of truth, right and tolerance which applied in the domestic politics as well.
6. Cold war 2.0 – 2 dimensions now – China and US – Russia and US
7. New evolving challenges like climate change, terrorism etc. NAM can reinvent itself to tackle these challenges
8. NAM can also be useful in bringing reforms in UNSC and WTO negotiations.
9. Neo imperialism and Neo-Colonialism – MNC’s colonizing third world countries. Eg: China’s engagement in Africa. They support insurgent groups to bring a regime that is in their favour. Closed model of development in Africa. Selling of weapons to Zimbabwean and Sudanese autocratic govt which they even used against its own citizens.


The attitude of the Modi government towards NAM got crystallized when former foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said at the 2019 **Raisina Dialogue** that “India has moved on from its non-aligned past. India is today an aligned state - but based on issues.

>Was Jawaharlal Nehru justified in adopting the principle of non-alignment as the corner-stone of India’s foreign policy? #PYMQ 2000

>The policy of nonalignment was enunciated by Pandit Nehru and it has become a cornerstone of the foreign policy of independent India. What are the principles underlying the concept of nonalignment? Has this policy been fruitful? Give reasons for your views. #PYMQ 1980

</div></div>


### 1961-1971 - Period of wars
- Economic contraction, ship-to-mouth situation.
- Pakistan aligned more closer to USA, [[Cold War\|Cold War]] at its peak. Relevance of [[Non Alignment Movement\|NAM]] questioned.
### 1971-1985 - Indira Era
- Economic self-sufficiency
- India supported Palestinian cause.

### 1985-1990 - Rajiv Era
- Technology revolution through telecom sector, Agni missile-tested.
- Slight tilt towards USA and China (set up Joint Working Groups)
### 1990-1996
- Closer to USA
- [[GS 1/HISTORY/POST INDEPENDENCE/ECONOMIC REFORMS\|LPG reforms]]; tilt towards west. Need for investment.
#### Look East Policy (PV Narasimha Rao-1992)
- Look East policy focused on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries + Economic Integration.
	- India became a dialogue partner of ASEAN in 1996 and summit level partner in 2002.
	- In 2012 the relationship got **up-graded into a Strategic Partnership**.
	- The time when India launched the Look East Policy in 1992, India's trade with ASEAN was USD 2 billion. After signing the Free Trade Agreement in 2010 with ASEAN, the trade has grown to USD 72 billion (2017-18).
	- India is also an active participant in several regional forums like the East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) etc.
	- It is an attempt to neutralize the influence of China in the SEA
- >Evaluate the economic and strategic dimensions of India’s Look East Policy in the context of the post-Cold War international scenario. #PYMQ 2016
#### Gujral Doctrine (I.K Gujral-1996)
- Gujral doctrine was launched by I K Gujral to decrease trust deficit and increase relationship and cooperation between India and its neighbours. 
- It was launched in 1996.
##### Why it was launched
- India’s neighbours felt that India has a ‘**Big brother**’ attitude (India's high-handedness) towards them. 
	- India’s size in south Asia, Size of Indian economy as well as the military power of India was the reason. 2/3rd of area, 3/4th of population. This **asymmetric relation** caused them to feel the same.
- India was recognizing the fact that a peaceful periphery was in India’s interest.
- Recognizing the fact that for becoming a global power, India should first become a regional power.
- The bottom line of Gujral doctrine is "**Waiver of reciprocity**"

##### Principles of the doctrine
- **Principle of asymmetrical engagement** – India would engage with neighbours in such a way that India would not expect anything in return-**unilateral concessions to neighbours**. Eg: India finances a large part of Bhutan’s GDP expenditure – almost 25%. Bangladesh land boundary agreement was beneficial for Bangladesh when we consider the area transferred to them. ==Goodwill is the only factor that India expect from them.==
- Remaining principles was inspired by Panchsheel principles:
	- Non-interference in affairs of another country.
	- Peaceful settlement of disputes through bilateral discussions.
	- Respect territorial integrity and sovereignty
	- No south Asian country should allow use of its territory against another south Asian country.
- >Explain what is Gujral doctrine. Critically analyse its contemporary relevance. #MPQ
- >What is meant by Gujral doctrine? Does it have any relevance today? Discuss. #PYMQ 2013.
### 1996-2014
- Second nuclear test in 1998, followed by economic sanctions on India. FP struggled for 4-5 years to overcome it. Tensions with USA.
- [[Wars fought by India#Kargil conflict\|Kargil crisis in 1999]]
- Indo-US nuclear deal 
### 2014-to present - Modi Era
- The present governments' FP is guided by 3 new determinants. [**3C's**]
	- Commerce
	- Culture and 
	- Connectivity
- According to new Government, the five main ingredients of India's FP are;
	- Dignity
	- Dialogue
	- Security
	- Shared prosperity
	- Culture

#### Act East
- Act East Policy focus on ASEAN countries + Economic Integration + East Asian countries + Security cooperation.
- Prime minister of India highlighted 4C's of Act East Policy.
	-	Culture
	-	Commerce
	-	Connectivity
	-	Capacity building
-	==Security is an important dimension of India's Act East Policy.==
	-	In the context of growing Chinese assertiveness in the **South China Sea** and the [[Indian Ocean\|Indian Ocean]], securing freedom of navigation and India's own role in the Indian Ocean is a key feature of Act East Policy.
	-	In pursuance of this, India has been engaged under the narrative of Indo-pacific and informal grouping called [[QUAD\|Quad]].

#### Look West policy
It has 3 important dimensions
1. Better relationship with Saudi Arabia.
	1. As the interest of India and Saudi happens to be complementary to each other
	2. For India, Saudi is not just a source of energy but also a major a source of investment and a corridor to the Africa.
2. Better ties with Iran
	1. Not just for meeting energy requirements, but for **Look North Policy** of India as well. (==Iran is the gateway to the central Asian countries==)
3. Better relations with Israel
	1. Not only for supply of defence weapons, but for collaboration in the development of technology. e.g. agricultural technology

But these three nations are traditionally enemies of each other. Hence ==India's look west policy have to do a hard balancing act.==

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/abraham-accords/#3b6154" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



- The signing of Abraham Accords helped to remove strategic obstacles for New Delhi and aided defence cooperation in West Asia 

</div></div>



#### Neighborhood first
Neighborhood first policy, accords primacy to nations in periphery with focus on encouraging trade, connectivity and people-to-people contact.
- Today Indian FP is not just about big power diplomacy - rather it also focus on neighborhood. Reflected in neighborhood first policy of India.
- The neighborhood of India is very very crucial for the Indian Foreign Policy, because what we do with respect to our neighborhood level has a repercussion on India’s international image because India wants to become a global power.
- Any country that wants to become a global power has to have a stable peaceful neighborhood. Therefore, India invests a lot of diplomatic energy in the neighborhood.
- Neighbourhood first Policy indicates four things:
	- India will be giving political and diplomatic priorities to her immediate neighbours and Indian Ocean Island states.
	- India to provide all essential requirements of her immediate neighbours as needed by them.
	- To promote greater connectivity and integration in the Indian subcontinent to ensure a free flow of goods and services, people, capital etc.
	- To establish an India-led regionalism in the neighbourhood.
- How does Modi work out his Neighbourhood first Policy?
	- Narendra Modi’s decision to invite all South Asian heads of state for his swearing in ceremony signaled that the neighbourhood would be central to his foreign policy. Except for the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, every other head from the neighbourhood attended the swearing in ceremony that showed the positive outlook towards Modi’s government in India by its neighbours.
	- This instance can also be termed as a geopolitical strategy of Modi as China looms large on the horizon, India has to have a definite role in the Indian subcontinent and ensure its sphere of influence in its neighbouring countries.
## Changing trends in India's foreign policy
- India was a recipient of loans and grants by developed nations, but now it is responsible for giving financial assistance to other nations.
- FP of India was initially based on idealism. But now its more based on realism. e.g. relationship with Israel. Earlier India was a vocal supporter of Palestine – now we are following **de-hyphenated policy**. Changing dynamics of India-US relations is another example. Indian firms bought lesser-priced Russian oil amidst Russian-Ukraine war and western sanctions on Russia.
- FP is now framed after discussions and debates and on consensus reached. It is hardly influenced by ideology of our leaders.
- Indian FP is moving ahead from political diplomacy to economic diplomacy, which can be best witnessed [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/India-China\|India-China]] relations. Also [[India-Japan\|India-Japan]] relations are mainly economic in nature.
- ==FP of India is a blend of Hard and Soft power.== India uses hard power against China and Pakistan while soft power against other neighbours.
- Indian FP is presently guided by two important considerations.
	- Energy requirement of India
	- The flow investment to India for infrastructural development
- The FP of India focuses on environmental concerns. But India would not allow these concerns to affect the development of India. (e.g. [[India and Climate Change#COP26 Glasgow\|India's stand in COP26]])
- The present government's policy is based on neighborhood first doctrine-to develop better ties with neighbours if India has to become a global leader.
- India's FP is also determined by the support of vast [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/INDIAN DIASPORA\|INDIAN DIASPORA]]. They are a part of middle and upper classes in different nations and exert pressure on the governments to frame policies which favours Indian interests.
- India is now engaging in multilateral diplomacy – eg: BRICS, G20, SCO and NSG.
- Use of Para diplomacy in FP.
	
### Elements of continuity
Elements of continuity - in the form of principles of Panchsheel, NAM, voice against Fascism and racism, non nuclear proliferation etc.
### Elements of change
1.  Socialist mode - Capitalist mode of production
2.  GP - GE(eg. Indo China - trade crossed $80 billion)
3.  Anti west to pro west inclination.
4.  Idealism to Realism ( erstwhile Soviet countries - showing pragmatism) idealism - simply living on assumptions , - realism focuses on state security and power above all else. Idealism in foreign policy holds that a state should make its internal political philosophy the goal of its foreign policy. For example, an idealist might believe that ending poverty at home should be coupled with tackling poverty abroad. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was an early advocate of idealism.
5.  India wants to be great power itself rather than becoming the leader of third world countries or NAM.
6.  NAM - multi alignment.

## Some Idealistic principles in India's FP
1. Panchsheel
2. NAM
3. Disarmament - India stands for complete elimination of nuke weapons. India - would use nuke as weapons of last resort. If India is attacked by biological/chemical or nuclear weapons.
4.  India is against any kind of Racial discrimination which was practiced in Asia and Africa when India got independence.

## Hard power and Soft power
The idea to distinguish between hard power and soft power was first conceived bu Joseph Nye.
### Hard power
- Hard Power: The term hard power describes a nation or political body’s ability to use economic incentives or military strength to influence other actors’ behaviors.
	- Hard power is linked with the possession of certain **tangible resources**, including population, territory, natural resources, economic and military strength, among others.
	- Hard power is time-effective and generating hard power requires much less time as its resources are tangible.
- Examples of hard power:
	- Trade sanctions imposed by US on Iran’s economy in order to isolate and cripple Iranian economy portrays usage of economic hard power.
	- The US return to military action in Iraq and direct intervention in Syria.
	- Russia’s annexation of Crimea and destabilization of eastern Ukraine.
	- China’s assertion of its territorial claims in the East and South China.
	- India’s blockage of supply and fuel in 2015 during Nepal Blockade.

- Limitations of hard power:
	- Doesn’t work during deadlocks: When there is deadlock between two nations usage of hard power further aggravates the problem.
	- Not possible for weak states: Hard power needs enough resources and financial capacity to generate, hence hard power doesn’t work for weak states.
	- Effects are momentary and usually backfire: Usually results of coercive hard power are limited and backfire in later stages for example use of coercive power in World War I acted as genesis of WWII and more recently US’ hard power in Afghanistan has failed to produce tangible results.
### Soft power
- India has ranked 27th, in the Global Soft-Power Index 2020. 
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



14. ==Mahatma Gandhi said that power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of punishment.==

</div></div>


- Soft Power: Soft power is persuasive power deriving from attraction and emulation and grounded on **intangible resources** like tourism, culture, and heritage.
	- It is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion, as used in hard power.
	- The importance and relevance of soft power is growing as more of humanity becomes connected. This dramatically enhanced presence everywhere on the globe has the potential to generate a surge of global opinion.
	- Soft power is useful in complex situations and helps a nation to achieve difficult outcomes. India received a nuclear waiver in 2008 despite not being a member of NSG because of its history of non-alignment and strong political ideals.
- 3 pillars of soft power.
	- Foreign policy of a country – non-alignment, Panchsheel etc. we do not go for coercive diplomacy, we have promoted non- interference and mutual growth.
	- Political values – democracy in India and easy transfer of powers after elections. Election commission of India – helped in conducting elections in Africa. We have built parliament for Afghanistan, once again an example of Political values of India in building democracy.
	- Cultural values – we give importance to cultural level aspects. Public diplomacy – Involving diaspora in foreign policy. US nuclear deal with pressure from Indian diaspora in US.
- Examples of soft power:
	- **Incredible India Campaign**: It is an international tourism campaign initiated by the government to promote India as a popular tourist destination using India’s heritage like images of the Himalayas, the Taj Mahal, yoga and multiplicity of colorful religious and cultural traditions etc.
		- Opening of Kushinagar Airport with flights to Sri Lanka and other SEA countries as a part of cultural diplomacy.
	- **International Day of Yoga:** Prime Minister Modi’s effort to have the United Nations declare the International Day of Yoga on June 21 each year is a major step in the right direction.
	- **International meetings**: The Prime Minister drove a common link between India and Central Asia by highlighting ideals of Islam- knowledge, piety, compassion and welfare, shared by both.
	- **India’s volunteering efforts:** India has often humanitarian rescue missions like Nepal floods, Sri Lanka floods recently to generate its soft power in the world.
	- **European Union:** EU has successfully used its soft power which derives from its readiness to offer a seat at the decision making table to all members to attract new members. Thus, the EU’s soft power is beneficial for its member states as well as for the EU itself.
- Limitations of soft power:
	- **Weak power:** Soft power resource as cultural influence does not equal political power, which is direct and more influencing**.**
	- **Limited scope:** Outcomes of soft power strategies depends on particular circumstances which cannot necessarily be influenced by states. For example, Buddhist heritage as a soft power can be used in Southeast and East Asian states, but not beyond.
- **Long drawn and blurred process:** Soft power as a diplomatic tool works very slowly. There is no concrete strategy used in soft power and the changes are usually very subtle.
- **Limited contemporary usage:** Currently world is experiencing grave problems like non-state cross-border terrorism, direct belligerence like Chinese Doklam incursion which can be better dealt with hard power.
	
### Smart power
The demise of hard power is caused by changes in the world order, whereas the strength of soft power is transient in nature. Hence, it is worth considering the strength of **smart power** strategies.
- Smart power is defined as the capacity of an actor to combine elements of hard power and soft power in ways that are mutually reinforcing such that the actor’s purposes are advanced effectively and efficiently. #definition 
- Smart power draws from both hard and soft power resources. It is an approach that underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships, and institutions.
- India’s current foreign policy is placed on the concept of smart power. For example,
	- India resisted Chinese incursion in Doklam by effective troop management at the border during the crisis to showcase its hard power but at the same time meetings like **Wuhan Summit** depict its soft power approach.
	- Similarly India and Pakistan maintain effective military presence in border areas but continue to find new ways of engagement through efforts like Kartarpur Corridor.
	-  The launching of South Asian satellite by India and allowing free usage of its services to all neighboring countries is a perfect example of using economic strength to generate trust among neighbours.

# India's nuclear doctrine 
>China, India, Pakistan are expanding nuclear arsenal. Number of nuclear warheads (13080 in 2021) globally appears to be increasing. #facts #introduction 
## India's nuclear doctrine
>Elaborate on India's Nuclear Doctrine. #PYMQ 2007
- India had made its Nuclear Doctrine in 2003.
- The basic principle of India's nuclear doctrine is "No First Use". According to this policy, nuclear weapons will only be used in retaliation against a nuclear attack on Indian Territory or on Indian forces anywhere.
- India needs to build and maintain a "Credible Minimum Deterrent". This includes:
	- Sufficient and survivable nuclear forces to inflict unacceptable damage to the enemy.
	- Forces must be operationally prepared at all times.
	- Effective intelligence and Early Warning Capabilities.
	- Communication of deterrence capability to the enemy.
- Policy of non-use against non-nuclear weapon states.
- The right to take nuclear action against the enemy will only be taken by the elected representatives of the people. i.e. the political leadership of the country, although the cooperation of Nuclear Command Authority will be necessary.
- The bureaucracy is not authorised to take decision of the nuclear  attack on the enemy.
- India will continue to support the global initiative to created a nuclear free world and will push forward the idea of "discrimination free nuclear disarmament"

### Delhi declaration
- The Delhi Declaration, issued by Rajiv Gandhi and Mr. Gorbachev, called for the complete destruction of nuclear arsenals before the end of the century, and asserted the importance of solving problems in a nonviolent way.
- It was a landmark document, not just in the context of its advocacy of complete nuclear disarmament but it also made history through the Soviet ideological acceptance for the first time of the concept of nonviolence.
- The Delhi Declaration strengthened the philosophical, political, moral, humanitarian and ethical aspects of the principles of non-use of force in interstate relations. 
- In the nuclear world, it is essential to rebuild interstate relations in such a manner that confrontation gives way to cooperation and conflict is resolved through peaceful political means alone, not by military means.
- However, gradually people across the world started realising that the document was a quantum jump towards the philosophy of not merely co-existence but global existence. 
- The Delhi Declaration appeals to the global community to accept non-violence and non-use of force as the cardinal principles of international behaviour.

## Challenges in making world go nuclear free
1. Many countries are not willing to give up nuclear weapons to secure their people and land. Nuclear arms race among the countries especially between U.S, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea seems to be increased not showing any declining trend.
2. Double standards of western countries are also to be blamed. In the recent Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington, US urged other countries to give up nuclear weapons but simultaneously are having plans to spend $1 trillion for modernisation of its nuclear inventory in the coming three decades.
3. Discriminatory nuclear regimes such as CTBT and NPT that have been designed to maintain status quo and keep emerging powers deprived.
4. Discriminatory responses to nuclear proliferation by the West that applaud Israel and punish Iran, North Korea.
5. Lack of genuine initiatives in UN that can lead to nuclear nonproliferation. The new START between US-Russia are simply a chimera. This in turn raises the question of genuine UN reforms.
6. More than anything else, the genuine lack of interest among nuclear powers to give up the weapons so as to maintain the balance of power is the biggest obstacle in achieving a nuke free world.
## Challenges to nuclear energy
1. According to IAEA, just three nuclear reactors started construction world wide last year. In contrast 20 to 30 new were being built every year in the 1960s and 1970s.
2. The emergence of cheap shale oil and gas has made competition in the energy sector tougher than ever. Wind and solar power generation are also growing as viable, alternative energy sources.
3. Toshiba and Hitachi, the nuclear heavy weights, are facing huge losses. Toshiba has filed for bankruptcy recently.
4. In the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the nuclear industry is facing a global crisis and a slowdown.
5. Stricter safety regulations have spiked the costs of constructing plants and some countries have become more cautious about new reactors.
6. Nuclear projects are also facing problems from domestic opposition from people residing in the area. e.g. Kudankulam project.

## Tactical nuclear weapon
- A tactical nuclear weapon or non-strategic nuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon which is designed to be used on a battlefield in military situations mostly with friendly forces in proximity and perhaps even on contested friendly territory.

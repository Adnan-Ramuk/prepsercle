# Defence
## Recent developments
- India's defence expenditure as a share of GDP has been falling.
- Ukraine is looking at defence purchases from India.
- More than half of capital allocation of 1.35 lakh crore in the defence budget would be reserved for domestic purchase.
- Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX) initiative Indian arms imports down by 33%. Russia is largest supplier followed by France and Israel. U.S is the fourth largest supplier.
- Brahmos - India's first supersonic cruise missile - with a speed of Mach 2.8 range of at least 290 km (new version can reach up to 400 km) - goals set to achieve hypersonic speed (at or above Mach 5), and a maximum range of 1500 km. 
	- Export of Brahmos to countries like Philippines would boost the credibility of India as a defence exporter, help it meet the target of $5 billion in defence exports by 2025.
		- Challenge 1 : about 65% of the components are provided by NPO -Russia. Hence the export of Brahmos may attract sanctions by USA under CAATSA.
			- CAATSA was not designed harm friends and allies of US - former US Ambassador.
		- Challenge 2 : cost of Brahmos may be unaffordable to interested countries. to solve this India offered defence line of credit to Philippines.
- Naresh Chandra committee - creation of Department of Military Affairs (DMA), appointment of [[Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)\|Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)]], 
- DRDO developed crystal blades for aero engines using nickel based super alloy.

## Defence procurement and manufacturing 
>India is one of the largest importers of conventional defence equipments and spends about 31.1% of its total defence budget on capital acquisitions. About 70% of its defence requirements are met through imports. #facts #introduction 
### DPP, 2016
1. DPP, 2016 focuses on institutionalising, streamlining and simplifying defence procurement procedure to give a boost to “Make in India” initiative, by promoting indigenous design, development and manufacturing of defence equipment.
2. The category of Buy (Indian - IDDM) has been accorded top most priority for procurement of capital equipment.
3. It involves an initial procurement of equipment followed by indigenous production through comprehensive transfer of technology.
4. It aims at developing long-term indigenous defence capabilities. It reserves projects not exceeding development cost of Rs. 10 crore (government funded) and Rs. 3 crore (industry funded) for MSMEs.
5. DPP also provides for a Defence Offset Policy.
### Other policies
1. Strategic Partnership Policy: Under this policy an Indian private company would be selected in each segment which would tie up with shortlisted global Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to manufacture the platforms in India under technology transfer.
2. FDI Policy has been revised to allow under automatic route up to 74% and beyond 74% through Government route.
3. Government is establishing two Defence Industrial Corridors (Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu).
4. Launch of ‘Mission Raksha Gyan Shakti’ which aims to provide boost to the IPR culture in indigenous defence industry.
5. Defence Investor Cell has been created in the Ministry to provide all necessary information required for investment in the sector.
4. Developing an indigenous defence manufacturing industry has strategic, economic and social advantages. India needs to pursue the idea of indigenisation with strong commitment.

### Private participation in defence production

#### Advantages of private participation
1. It will cut down on our imports saving valuable forex reserves. As defence sector is evergreen, our exports will go up. India’s defence budget was $40.4 billion last year. This can be reduced if private players play a significant role.
2. It will lead to competition which was not present earlier. Competition will enhance product innovation, technology upgradation, quality control, export promotion, finance and human resource management.
3. State-of-the-art production in India will modernise defence industrial setup and give strategical advantages.
4. Generation of jobs that will come handy to both skilled workforce and unskilled people. This can be a pillar to reap the benefits of demographic dividend.
5. Self reliance and curtailing over dependence on foreign suppliers. We have had bad past experiences during wartime when we were either denied supply of equipment or the services were compromised.
6. We can develop defence equipment specially for our needs. Ex: Siachen heights equipment, etc.
7. This will reduce corruption in defence deals as India may not have to make foreign defence purchases. India has spent around $50 billion on defence purchases in the last decade.
8. Expertise in defence sector provides enormous spin-off benefits. Over the years, as Israel developed capabilities in defence electronics, it has also built a reputation in areas such as medical equipment, digital communication and advanced agricultural technologies.
#### Challenges to private participation
1. Private players in defence are restricted from participation in foreign countries through rigorous export control laws by the government of their home countries. Any technology transfer is highly unlikely unless India succeeds in persuading the governments in their home countries.
2. Financial allocation to R&D vis-a-vis capital acquisition in defence budget has declined in past decade. FDI cap of 49% is hindering the effective participation.
3. Requirements of the armed forces are not made known to the private sector sufficiently in advance. This hinders private enthusiasm.
4. India has been availing technology through licensing agreements, which have been prohibitory for local development and reduced defence PSUs role as maintenance agencies or manufacturer of small arms.
5. Slow and complex decision making regarding defence procurement and the lack of military inputs in decision making. 
6. Land acquisition is another major challenge.
7. Defence industry continues to be dominated by companies based in the US and western Europe, with firms from these areas taking up the top 10 positions on the list of the biggest arms makers. This may pose various strategic concerns for India.

#### Government efforts
1. Government is placing its focus on indigenisation of the industry and acquiring advanced technologies from abroad.
2. Under Make in India programme, the government has given licenses to many private companies to manufacture products for the country’s defence needs.
3. Government has recently come up with Defence Procurement Policy, 2016.
4. The new defence offset policy, whereby foreign suppliers of equipment need to manufacture a certain percentage of their products in India, has given Indian firms a chance to play partners to global companies.
5. With a focus to give boost to indigenous private defence manufacturers, Defence ministry recently took leap forward steps by accepting the recommendations made by expert committee headed by Dhirendra Singh.
##### Highlights of DPP 2016
1. Creation of Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured (IDDM) platforms, which will get top priority while buying equipment and will be the first to be chosen for tenders.
2. Offsets clause increased from the current Rs.300 crore to Rs.2000 crore giving flexibility for foreign companies. Any greater value of contract will be re-invested (30%) in Indian defence industries which will help to upgrade indigenous technological capabilities and know-how.
3. DPP-16 also states that 100% refund from the government, in case of delay of procurement from vendor.
4. Defence ministry has also decided to fund private R&D, so as to build a technology base.
5. Empowered committee is created to solve disputes or unforeseen issues. But it is still without crucial chapters on strategic partnerships and blacklisting norms in case of wrongdoing.
### Steps to be taken
1. Bilateral talks need to be strengthened to persuade the foreign government for allowing their defence companies to share their critical technology and know how.
2. Removal of all discriminatory treatments, regressive tax regimes and duties for local defence manufacturers vis-a-vis foreign manufacturers.
3. Providing easy availability of land and capital without inordinate delays and swift single window and time bound clearances.
4. Tax incentives and easy credit facilities need to be given to generate interest and attract foreign manufacturers in defence sectors.
6. Security infrastructure to be upgraded to avoid any data theft or cyber hacks of classified data.
5. Time is now ripe for creating accountability structures for such leaks and corruption scandals.

## Why defence corruption exists
1. India imports a big chunk of its armoury and hence, the probability of one or two out of the many transactions to involve corruption, increases.
2. Defence procurement is giant plausible source of [[black economy\|black money]]. Black marketers make full use of the opportunity this sector offers.
3. The institutes of Lokpal and Central Vigilance Commission are not strengthened enough to take meaningful actions. Also the audits of the CAG are post event evaluations.
4. Since there have been cases of corruption with the CBI too, genuine investigation becomes all the more difficult.
5. Till the time the cases reach the courts, the probability of manipulating or removing the evidences and witnesses increases.
### Rafale deal
- The role of middlemen in both the bid process and the Rafale sale agreement must be probed.
- French media reported published set of alleged fake invoices. Indian media had revealed procedural violations, raised questions over high price of the fighters, the choice of offset partners, the removal anti-corruption clauses.
- Government must ensure a transparent procurement procurement process. 

## Defence R&D
### Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) 
- The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics is located in Bangalore, Karnataka. It was set up in 1986. 
- The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) is the main laboratory of the DRDO for research and development in diverse areas of defence, Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 
- It is involved in the research & development of high-quality Secure Communication, Command and Control, and Intelligent Systems.
#### Projects of CAIR
- Some of the notable projects of the organisation are listed below:
	- **NETRA:** NETRA (Network Traffic Analysis) is a software network developed by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, laboratory, and is used by the Intelligence Bureau, and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), to intercept and analyse internet traffic using pre-defined filters. 
	- The program was tested at smaller scales by various national security agencies and is reported to be deployed nationwide soon, as of January 2014.
-  **Muntra:** Muntra is an unmanned armoured vehicle developed by India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation. 
-  The name stands for “Mission Unmanned Tracked”. While referred to as a “tank” by the Indian media, it is a conversion of the Soviet BMP-2 armoured personnel carrier. 
-  Current variants are unarmed. 
-  Three variants exist: Muntra-S for surveillance, Muntra-M for mine clearing, and Muntra-N operating in nuclear or chemical contaminated zones.

## Defence sector reforms
- Absence of a clearly enunciated National Security Strategy (NSS): Lack of proactive planning in defence as Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) does not meet quite often to review any emerging situations.
- Inefficient functioning of the National Security Council (NSC): Council’s charter involves the evolution of an integrated NSS and the provision of guidance for long-term defence planning, but it seldom meets.
- Lack of security reviews in place: Only time a serious security review was undertaken in the recent past was after the Kargil Conflict of 1999.
- Delayed Defence Acquisition: Bureaucratic redtapism adversely affecting the acquisition of new weapons and equipments by the armed forces. This leads to annual defence budgets remaining unutilised and continuing to lapse back to the Ministry of Finance at the end of the financial year.
- High fiscal deficit: Increasing fiscal deficit due to increased defence imports.
- Issues with Defence Research and Development: Long term research required for self reliance in defence production is in contrast with the desire for defence imports as a quick fix to immediate requirements.
	- Prevailing disconnect in the interface between R&D, production agencies and users.
- Difficulty in Attracting Foreign Investments: Foreign Investments (FDI) remains crucial for infusion of cutting edge technology. However, there are several issues which hamper the inflow of defence-related FDI in India.
- Lack of co-ordination among various forces: Results in inefficient use of resources as well as affects the quick decision making during emergency war-like situations.
- India is not equipped to counter hybrid warfare
- Simultaneous aggression from multiple fronts.
- Poor adoption of technology.
- China's increasing nuclear capability
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Role of external state and non state actors in creating challenges to internal security#Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan Security of India\|Unstable Afganistan and Taliban's takeover]]

### Defence sector reforms undertaken
- Chief of Defence Staff & Department of Military Affairs (DMA): The post of CDS was created to increase efficiency & coordination among the Armed Forces and reduce duplication, while DMA was established to ensure improved civil-military integration.
- Self-Reliance in Defence: To promote ‘Make in India’ in the defence sector, a list of 101 defence items for which there would be an embargo on the import was notified.
- Change in FDI policy: The government earlier allowed 49% of FDI under the automatic route. But in 2020 the government increased this to 74%. This will act as a major boost to the defence sector as it will not only increase FDI but it will also increase the number of startups.
- Increased Defence Exports: The increased partnership with the private sector has led to a substantial rise in defence exports.
	- The value of total defence exports rose from Rs 1,941 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 9,116 crore in 2019-20. Also, for the first time, India figured in the list of defence equipment exporting nations, as the exports expanded to more than 84 countries.
- Defence Acquisitions: New Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 was unveiled. First five Rafale fighter aircraft arrived in India in July 2020 and several more since then, adding firepower to the arsenal of the Indian Air Force.
- Reforming Defence R&D: Five Young Scientists Laboratories of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were launched in 2020 to promote innovation by young minds.
	- DRDO has joined hands with the private sector in design & development and identified 108 Systems & Subsystems for the industry to design, develop and manufacture.
- Digital Transformation: Directorate General Quality Assurance (DGQA) started online Pre-Delivery inspection in May 2020 to address security threats.
	- The Armed Forces Tribunal began digital hearing for the first time in August 2020.
- Participation of Women in Armed Forces: Ten streams of Indian Army were opened for giving Permanent Commission to Short Service Commission (SSC) Women officers.
	- All Sainik Schools were thrown open for girl students from academic session 2020- 21.
- Strengthening Border Infrastructure: Reforms of processes and workflows within Border Roads Organisation (BRO) enabled it to achieve targets ahead of schedule, in some instances.
	- World’s longest Atal tunnel above 10,000 feet, at Rohtang on the Leh-Manali Highway was inaugurated.
- Reforms in National Cadet Corps: Expanding the reach of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) to remote locations was a major announcement. It was decided to give preference to NCC cadets in employment in Central Armed Police Forces from May 2020.
- Aid to Civil Administration during emergencies like Covid-19: The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces have mobilised resources to aid the civil administration in the fight against #COVID-19 . DRDO has set up several hospitals to treat COVID patients across the states, passed on technology expertise to the private sector for mass production of covid related medicines and equipment. e.g. #COVID-19 drug 2 DG.
### Way Forward
- Formulate a comprehensive NSS: The first and foremost requirement is for the government to formulate a comprehensive NSS, inclusive of internal security so that all the stakeholders are aware of what is expected of them.
- Establish a permanent National Security Commission – mandated by an act of parliament - to oversee the development of military and non-military capacities for national security.
- Tri-Service Command: Increasing technological disruptions has given birth to Hybrid warfare.
- Implement Naresh Chandra #committee Recommendation: The government must accord the highest priority to the implementation of the recommendations of the Naresh Chandra Committee. Implementation of these recommendations will help the country’s armed forces to become well prepared to meet future threats and challenges and contribute positively to security in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region alongside India’s strategic partners.
- Defence Reforms Under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan: Government has done well by announcing a slew of reforms under Atma-Nirbhar Abhiyan, these help in attracting FDI, streamlining time-bound defence procurement, and boosting domestic participation in the defence sector.
- The government have to improve the in-house design capacity like that of Naval Design Bureau. This will reduce the conflict with manufacturers in design and capacity. Shekatkar committee recommended transformation of ‘The Military Intelligence School’ at Pune into ‘tri-service intelligence training establishment’.
- Greater technology adoption in border management as recommended by Madhukar Gupta #committee 
- Need a comprehensive cyber security doctrine.
- Revision of no-first-use policy.

- “New kinds of threats like [[Emerging security threats#Hybrid warfare\|hybrid warfare]] have blurred the line between internal and external security.
- There are wide range of threats to national security, such as terrorism, cyber attacks, border disputes, internal unrest, natural disasters, and geopolitical challenges.
- India's national security is managed by various agencies, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), and National Security Council (NSC). 
- The government of India has taken several measures to strengthen national security, including the modernization of defence forces, intelligence gathering and sharing, border management, and diplomatic engagement with other countries.

2. Removal of all discriminatory treatments, regressive tax regimes and duties for local defence manufacturers vis-a-vis foreign manufacturers.
3. Providing easy availability of land and capital without inordinate delays and swift single window and time bound clearances.
4. Tax incentives and easy credit facilities need to be given to generate interest and attract foreign manufacturers in defence sectors.
6. Security infrastructure to be upgraded to avoid any data theft or cyber hacks of classified data.
5. Time is now ripe for creating accountability structures for such leaks and corruption scandals.

## Why defence corruption exists
1. India imports a big chunk of its armoury and hence, the probability of one or two out of the many transactions to involve corruption, increases.
2. Defence procurement is giant plausible source of [[black economy\|black money]]. Black marketers make full use of the opportunity this sector offers.
3. The institutes of Lokpal and Central Vigilance Commission are not strengthened enough to take meaningful actions. Also the audits of the CAG are post event evaluations.
4. Since there have been cases of corruption with the CBI too, genuine investigation becomes all the more difficult.
5. Till the time the cases reach the courts, the probability of manipulating or removing the evidences and witnesses increases.
### Rafale deal
- The role of middlemen in both the bid process and the Rafale sale agreement must be probed.
- French media reported published set of alleged fake invoices. Indian media had revealed procedural violations, raised questions over high price of the fighters, the choice of offset partners, the removal anti-corruption clauses.
- Government must ensure a transparent procurement procurement process. 

## Defence R&D
### Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) 
- The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics is located in Bangalore, Karnataka. It was set up in 1986. 
- The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) is the main laboratory of the DRDO for research and development in diverse areas of defence, Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 
- It is involved in the research & development of high-quality Secure Communication, Command and Control, and Intelligent Systems.
#### Projects of CAIR
- Some of the notable projects of the organisation are listed below:
	- **NETRA:** NETRA (Network Traffic Analysis) is a software network developed by the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, laboratory, and is used by the Intelligence Bureau, and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), to intercept and analyse internet traffic using pre-defined filters. 
	- The program was tested at smaller scales by various national security agencies and is reported to be deployed nationwide soon, as of January 2014.
-  **Muntra:** Muntra is an unmanned armoured vehicle developed by India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation. 
-  The name stands for “Mission Unmanned Tracked”. While referred to as a “tank” by the Indian media, it is a conversion of the Soviet BMP-2 armoured personnel carrier. 
-  Current variants are unarmed. 
-  Three variants exist: Muntra-S for surveillance, Muntra-M for mine clearing, and Muntra-N operating in nuclear or chemical contaminated zones.

## Defence sector reforms
- Absence of a clearly enunciated National Security Strategy (NSS): Lack of proactive planning in defence as Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) does not meet quite often to review any emerging situations.
- Inefficient functioning of the National Security Council (NSC): Council’s charter involves the evolution of an integrated NSS and the provision of guidance for long-term defence planning, but it seldom meets.
- Lack of security reviews in place: Only time a serious security review was undertaken in the recent past was after the Kargil Conflict of 1999.
- Delayed Defence Acquisition: Bureaucratic redtapism adversely affecting the acquisition of new weapons and equipments by the armed forces. This leads to annual defence budgets remaining unutilised and continuing to lapse back to the Ministry of Finance at the end of the financial year.
- High fiscal deficit: Increasing fiscal deficit due to increased defence imports.
- Issues with Defence Research and Development: Long term research required for self reliance in defence production is in contrast with the desire for defence imports as a quick fix to immediate requirements.
	- Prevailing disconnect in the interface between R&D, production agencies and users.
- Difficulty in Attracting Foreign Investments: Foreign Investments (FDI) remains crucial for infusion of cutting edge technology. However, there are several issues which hamper the inflow of defence-related FDI in India.
- Lack of co-ordination among various forces: Results in inefficient use of resources as well as affects the quick decision making during emergency war-like situations.
- India is not equipped to counter hybrid warfare
- Simultaneous aggression from multiple fronts.
- Poor adoption of technology.
- China's increasing nuclear capability
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Role of external state and non state actors in creating challenges to internal security#Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan Security of India\|Unstable Afganistan and Taliban's takeover]]

### Defence sector reforms undertaken
- Chief of Defence Staff & Department of Military Affairs (DMA): The post of CDS was created to increase efficiency & coordination among the Armed Forces and reduce duplication, while DMA was established to ensure improved civil-military integration.
- Self-Reliance in Defence: To promote ‘Make in India’ in the defence sector, a list of 101 defence items for which there would be an embargo on the import was notified.
- Change in FDI policy: The government earlier allowed 49% of FDI under the automatic route. But in 2020 the government increased this to 74%. This will act as a major boost to the defence sector as it will not only increase FDI but it will also increase the number of startups.
- Increased Defence Exports: The increased partnership with the private sector has led to a substantial rise in defence exports.
	- The value of total defence exports rose from Rs 1,941 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 9,116 crore in 2019-20. Also, for the first time, India figured in the list of defence equipment exporting nations, as the exports expanded to more than 84 countries.
- Defence Acquisitions: New Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 was unveiled. First five Rafale fighter aircraft arrived in India in July 2020 and several more since then, adding firepower to the arsenal of the Indian Air Force.
- Reforming Defence R&D: Five Young Scientists Laboratories of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were launched in 2020 to promote innovation by young minds.
	- DRDO has joined hands with the private sector in design & development and identified 108 Systems & Subsystems for the industry to design, develop and manufacture.
- Digital Transformation: Directorate General Quality Assurance (DGQA) started online Pre-Delivery inspection in May 2020 to address security threats.
	- The Armed Forces Tribunal began digital hearing for the first time in August 2020.
- Participation of Women in Armed Forces: Ten streams of Indian Army were opened for giving Permanent Commission to Short Service Commission (SSC) Women officers.
	- All Sainik Schools were thrown open for girl students from academic session 2020- 21.
- Strengthening Border Infrastructure: Reforms of processes and workflows within Border Roads Organisation (BRO) enabled it to achieve targets ahead of schedule, in some instances.
	- World’s longest Atal tunnel above 10,000 feet, at Rohtang on the Leh-Manali Highway was inaugurated.
- Reforms in National Cadet Corps: Expanding the reach of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) to remote locations was a major announcement. It was decided to give preference to NCC cadets in employment in Central Armed Police Forces from May 2020.
- Aid to Civil Administration during emergencies like Covid-19: The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces have mobilised resources to aid the civil administration in the fight against #COVID-19 . DRDO has set up several hospitals to treat COVID patients across the states, passed on technology expertise to the private sector for mass production of covid related medicines and equipment. e.g. #COVID-19 drug 2 DG.
### Way Forward
- Formulate a comprehensive NSS: The first and foremost requirement is for the government to formulate a comprehensive NSS, inclusive of internal security so that all the stakeholders are aware of what is expected of them.
- Establish a permanent National Security Commission – mandated by an act of parliament - to oversee the development of military and non-military capacities for national security.
- Tri-Service Command: Increasing technological disruptions has given birth to Hybrid warfare.
- Implement Naresh Chandra #committee Recommendation: The government must accord the highest priority to the implementation of the recommendations of the Naresh Chandra Committee. Implementation of these recommendations will help the country’s armed forces to become well prepared to meet future threats and challenges and contribute positively to security in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region alongside India’s strategic partners.
- Defence Reforms Under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan: Government has done well by announcing a slew of reforms under Atma-Nirbhar Abhiyan, these help in attracting FDI, streamlining time-bound defence procurement, and boosting domestic participation in the defence sector.
- The government have to improve the in-house design capacity like that of Naval Design Bureau. This will reduce the conflict with manufacturers in design and capacity. Shekatkar committee recommended transformation of ‘The Military Intelligence School’ at Pune into ‘tri-service intelligence training establishment’.
- Greater technology adoption in border management as recommended by Madhukar Gupta #committee 
- Need a comprehensive cyber security doctrine.
- Revision of no-first-use policy.

	- Maintaining domestic peace
	- Preserving sovereignty
- Basic elements are: socio-political stability, economic security, energy security, environmental security etc.
- Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for internal security.

## Internal Security challenges in India

## Reasons behind weak internal security
- The nitty gritty of security management and lack of coordination and integrated approaches.
- Weak law and order system (Police continue to be in a shambles. The Supreme Court gave historic directions in 2006 for police reforms, but the states have been dragging it for too long)
- India lacks national security doctrine.
- Weak intelligence coordination and dissemination between various agencies.
- Lack of long-term policy:
	- There is no long-term policy for Jammu and Kashmir, nor is there any strategic vision to tackle the LWE.
- Issues in federal structure: A federal system with multi and regional party system also throws open the challenge of centre and state co-ordination.
## Some government initiatives
- NATGRID: The formation of an intelligence database designed to consolidate and make searchable data gathered by existing security and law enforcement agencies, will prove to be a vital link in India’s intelligence infrastructure.
- CCTNS: The Crime and Criminal Tracking Networks and System (CCTNS) is an initiative of the MHA, to facilitate storage, transfer and sharing of data and information between police stations.
- CERT-In: It is responsible for protection of cyber systems and it provides specific steps and countermeasures to patch the existing vulnerabilities and strengthen the security of these websites.
- SAMADHAN: On the Naxal front, the Conference of Chief Ministers of the affected states held in Delhi came up with a new formula of SAMADHAN to tackle the problem.
## Further measures to internal security challenges
- Police is generally the first agency to respond to internal security challenges. Impending police reforms (Prakash Singh judgment of SC) should be implemented to strengthen policing.
- The absence of a central institution to tackle terrorism has resulted in a fragmented approach to terrorism. Therefore, a central anti-terrorism agency, NCTC, should be established.
- Synergy between law enforcement, legal and judicial systems is essential. The prosecution of the perpetrators of terrorist acts needs to be expedited.
- Military pressure alone cannot resolve matters unless there is good governance, with a strong thrust on socio-political and socio-economic issues.
- Perception management has been the weakest link in India’s fighting against internal security problems. Counter narratives to the propaganda of the terrorists and insurgents should be developed. For example, Government is introducing courses on scientific interpretations of religious texts in Madrassas.
- Implementation of Make in India, National Manufacturing Policy, reviving textile MSMEs, improving ease of doing business etc. will generate much-needed jobs in India.
- In the Northeast, the Assam Rifles had been raised primarily for deployment in that area and comprised personnel from that region. Its composition was eventually changed to that of an all-India force which lead to loss of rapport.
- Internal funding sources for terrorists, money laundering, cyber thefts should be checked by the coordination of NIA, NATGRID, ED and IB.
- Terrorism has global dimension and effective cooperation should be secured with other nations to tackle it.
- Effective border management through ICPs, fences, regular visits of leaders in bordering areas is needed to curb insurgency in internal pockets.
- Implementation of National cyber security policy 2013 will reduce vulnerability of core infrastructure and secure banking, government and military communications.

[[18-08-2021-Wednesday\|18-08-2021-Wednesday]]  1:32 PM

# Threat of terrorism
>Terrorism is an act of disproportionate use of violence which create fear in the society, that ultimately helps to achieve a political, ideological or religious objective. #definition #introduction 
- Terrorism is an international phenomenon affecting Europe, Asia, Africa and other parts of the world.
- Many nations are affected, whether directly or indirectly. Recent attacks on Peshawar (2014), Paris (2015), Kabul (2016) and Pathankot (2016) as well as several earlier attacks shows highly asymmetric and unpredictable nature of terrorist attacks.
- According to global terrorism #index , India is 8th most vulnerable nation. #facts 
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Terrorism is both a global political problem and an internal psychological mechanism. Terrorism works by pressing the fear button deep in our minds and hijacking the private imagination of millions of individuals.

## Key observations regarding terrorism
- Rise in number of active terrorists groups such as ISIS, Al-Qaeda, JeM, Hamas etc. and each one having different agenda and role.
- Terrorist groups have access to advanced weapons and machinery being supplied by hidden agents.
- Rise of terrorist groups is also influenced by world power’s tactics or strategic moves like USA arming Islamist rebels in Syria to counter President Bashar al-Assad who is a Russian ally.
- There is no proactive or preventive strategy to handle such threats and most nations become concerned once damage is done.

## State sponsored terrorism
>State-sponsored terrorism is government support of violent non-state actors engaged in terrorism. This support could be to achieve multiple objectives such as de-stabilising popular government, or economic or strategic reasons. #definition 
- Iran has long been accused of funding terrorists by the US agencies most notably against Iraq and against Israel by funding groups like HAMAS and Lebanese Hezbollah. USA supporting Al-Qaeda to keep off the Russian military is another example.
- Pakistan intelligence agency ISI, has been found to be the planning and operating master of many terrorist attacks in India. The long and porous borders make India vulnerable to such acts. Pakistani army has been giving cover fire for the terrorists to enter into India.
- China is believed to be funding terrorist operations in North Eastern states. It is accused of giving shelter to ULFA members of Assam separatist movement.

## Terrorist financing
>Terrorist financing is the collection or the provision of funds for terrorist purposes. #definition #introduction 
- Terrorist financing involves the solicitation, collection or provision of funds with the intention that they may be used to support terrorist acts or organizations.
### Terror financing vs Money laundering
- In the case of money laundering, the funds are always of illicit origin, whereas in the case of terrorist financing, funds can stem from both legal and illicit sources. 
- The primary goal of individuals or entities involved in the financing of terrorism is therefore not necessarily to conceal the sources of the money but to conceal both the funding activity and the nature of the funded activity.
- Similar methods are used for both money laundering and the financing of terrorism. In both cases, the actor makes an illegitimate use of the financial sector.
- Also, AML and CFT strategies converge; they aim at attacking the criminal or terrorist organization through its financial activities, and use the financial trail to identify the various components of the criminal or terrorist network. This implies to put in place mechanisms to read all financial transactions, and to detect suspicious financial transfers.

## Lone wolf attacks
>"Lone-wolf" terrorism is the term used to describe someone who acts alone in a terrorist attack without the help or encouragement of a government or a terrorist organization. #definition 
- Increasing instances of lone-wolf terrorism in India is a major concern.
- Its nature makes it more difficult for security agencies to tackle it
- Stabbing outside the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and Udaipur killing in 2022 are examples of lone-wolf terrorism.

### Reasons for rise in lone wolf attacks
- In such attacks, actors allegedly act by themselves without any tactical or financial support from an established insurgent group or international terrorist organisation.
- It is an efficient way of spreading terror in hard to access places for terrorist groups like the IS as lone wolves typically remain off the security radar.
- Mostly attackers are self radicalised towards extremist ideology by accessing material on social media.
- The current gun sales environment in the US allows self radicalised to have licensed weapons with the right amount of push.

## Future of terrorism
- The use of [[Drone technology\|Drones]], autonomous weapon systems and robotic soldiers.
	- e.g. Syrian rebels used drones to attack Russian military bases in Syria, the recent Jammu drone attack.
- New modes of violence enabled by technology reduces costs and risk of identification while increasing their efficacy.
- Wassenaar Agreement and Missile Technology Control Regime etc. are largely useless in the emerging scenario.
- Cyber Terrorism
- Narco-Terrorism
- **Hybrid militants**: 
	- The term is used by the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Police for youths who are not listed as militants in its records, but who carry out terrorist attacks and then keep living as regular civilians, without going underground. As these youths live two lives - overtly acting as peaceable civilians, while secretly operating as militants - the name ‘hybrid militants’ has been given to explain the two-faced nature of their method.
	- The hybrid militants in J&K are mostly radicalised youth and not trained intelligence officers. They operate far more freely in committing wanton acts of terror than any dormant and dedicated ‘sleeper cell’
	- A hybrid militant poses as civilian to dissemble their violent activities thus making it more difficult for security forces to trace them or determine their activities
- **Sleeper cells**: sleeper cell operatives hide in plain sight, until they get activated on receiving instructions from their shadowy handlers. A sleeper is carefully selected and trained to bear the stress of operating inside enemy territory often as part of a long-term, strategic project that may take decades to reach fruition.
- narrative terrorism wherein as part of a criminal conspiracy  to spread terrorism and create a false narrative.
## Acts and initiatives to deal with terrorism
### International
- FATF - Financial Action Task Force 
	- A report by the FATF early this year had underlined the “complicated” pattern of funding being deployed to mobilise ISIS terrorists and in secretly moving.
	- FATF announced a new focus on "extreme right-wing terrorism (ERW)"
- International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism - 1999 
	- United Nations treaty designed to criminalize acts of financing terrorism.
- SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism
- [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)\|SCO]] RATS (Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure)
- [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism\|Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]]
	- CCCIT, drafted by India in 1996, is a proposed treaty which provides a comprehensive legal framework against terrorism. It includes following major objectives:
		- To have a universal definition of terrorism that all 193 - members of the UNGA will adopt into their own criminal law.
		- To ban all terror groups and shut down terror camps.
		- To prosecute all terrorists under special laws.
		- To make cross-border terrorism an extraditable offence worldwide.
##### Christchurch Call for Action
- The initiative “outlines collective, voluntary commitments from governments and online service providers intended to address the issue of terrorist and violent extremist content online and to prevent abuse of the internet as occurred in and after the Christchurch attacks”.
- The signatories promised to implement laws related to regulating terrorist content online and curbing the spread of extremism while maintaining international human rights laws. 
- The Christchurch Call for Action is a rare global pledge that **involves both governments and the private sector**.
- However, tech companies like Facebook and Google are becoming increasingly included in narratives on democracy, elections, privacy, and online terrorism.
- India also signed "Christchurch Call for Action"

### National
#### Legislations
- National Security Act, 1980
- Terrorist And Disruptive Activities (prevention) Act (TADA) - lapsed in 1995. It defined terrorist act, not terrorism.
- Prevention of Terrorist Act (POTA) was enacted after IC814 hijacking and Parliament attack. (raising funds for the purpose of terrorism was included). POTA was repealed in 2004, following the allegation of its misuse.
##### UAPA (1967)
- Primary counter-terror law in India.
- Unlawful activity - any action with intent to disrupt the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India.
- UAPA permits keeping a person for up to 180 days, without even filling a charge sheet.
- ==Instead of presumption of innocence, the UAPA holds presumption of guilt of the accused.==
- Act assigns absolute power to the central government.
- The text of the draconian laws sometimes poses immense challenge to the court by limiting the space for judicial discretion and adjudication.
- ![Pasted image 20220828172300.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220828172300.png)
#### Agencies
- NIA - National Investigation Agency
- National Security Guard (NSG) in major Cities
- NATGRID - Integrated National Intelligence Grid
- State Police Network CCTNS - Criminal and Crime Tracking and Network System
- NCTC - (Proposed: National Counter Terrorism Centre)
- Financial Intelligence Unit-IND
	- FIU-IND is the central national agency responsible for receiving, processing, analyzing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transactions.

##### Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) and Subsidiary Multi-Agency Centre (S-MAC)
- Counter terrorism centre
- It was formed in December 2001 following the Kargil intrusion and the subsequent overhaul of the Indian national security apparatus suggested by the Kargil Review #committee report.
- Mandate is to share terrorist related intelligence on a day to day basis. Works 24/7.
- MAC is under IB, head quarters in New Delhi.
- S-MAC is situated in various states.

#### Failure of Anti-terror legislation
Post independence, on the pretext of national security, India has experimented with number of anti-terrorism acts, right from MISA (Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971), NSA, POTA and TADA. The predicament set by centre is being followed by states like Maharashtra and now Gujarat. 
- The multiplicity of laws is the first problem.
- There is no liability on the state. Citizens who are wrongly charged under this law cannot sue the state or demand compensation because the state is protected from all such actions.
- Issue with most laws has been that they are enacted as a knee jerk reaction to some events (MISA during emergency, POTA during post parliament attack). This hurried state of enactments results in large loopholes, curtailing fundamental rights, etc.
- Such acts provide disproportionate power to police officials which have resulted in arbitrary arrests, cooked up charges, long detention without trial, torture, etc.
- They challenge cooperative federalism and focusses more on retribution than fair and transparent investigation and ultimately their provisions are opposed and are struck down in court of law.
- Compulsory installation of CCTV, as in Maharashtra act, is against the individual’s right of privacy.

#### Why air strikes are not effective against terrorism
- Instead of solving the problem it aggravates the situation. Air strikes in Syria and Afghanistan leads to emergence of more extreme groups.
- It takes a heavy toll on innocent civilians.
- Not taking a UN route which further weakens the chances of negotiation and peace.
- Air strikes is proving a boon to weapons makers and increasing their lobbying efforts.
- Air strikes has led to merging of two jihadist group and danger looms over Libya by Boko Haram and ISIS.

#### Failure of intelligence agencies
- Lack of expertise and infrastructure has resulted in a **substandard surveillance** from across the border resulting in ever increasing terror activities.
- Lack of coordination between Army, state police, paramilitary forces lead to confusing outcomes. Similarly there is no coordination between defence intelligence units like IB, NSA, NSC have been creating lacunae within.
- Hierarchical confusions arising because of presence of PMO, NSA, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs all in loop creating slip ups.
- Inputs gathered are either too late or not unabridged enough to know the exact nature of the activity. e.g. Information about Mumbai attack.
- Reports not tabled in Parliament and anonymity maintained as to how they function. This leads to lack of accountability.
- No parliamentary or public debate happens on working of these institutions which diminishes essence of democratic debates in country.

## What is needed rather than laws
- Rather than new law, need of the hour is **robust investigation system** via better training, infrastructure, application of modern technology, cutting edge forensic department, etc.
- Implementation of ARC recommendation of separation of investigation and law enforcement branch.
- Better coordination between centre and state and among states, plugging loopholes in UAPA is needed.
- Deeper engagement with [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\|SAARC]] and [[India - ASEAN\|ASEAN]] for intelligence collaboration, sharing best practices is also need of the hour as terrorism has become an international phenomenon.
- So, conventional methods of warfare wont work for upcoming threats and hence **a global comprehensive strategy is the need of hour**. We must focus on preventive measure and pro-actively dismantling the threats before they occur.

## Strategies for prevention of terrorist attacks
- UNSC can act as watchdog to keep an eye on world politics. It can warn and condemn neo cold war practices so that super powers doesn’t play their power games in disturbed countries like Syria, Afghanistan or recent North Korea.
- UN can play a key role in cutting access to finance and weapons supply to terrorists. Controlling of oil reserves which is backbone of IS for economic funding of its military
- [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism\|Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]]
- Increasing cooperation between countries which includes sharing lessons learnt, training personnel and emulating tactics, sharing intelligence and technology advancements.
- Multilateral counter terrorism bodies like GCTF could play a significant role via talks and policy proposals. Regional groups like South Asian countries can come up with an effective regional institution to share knowledge, resources to counter threats.
- Countries needs effective mechanism to monitor online activities as internet is becoming a key communication channel for terrorist groups. Although civil liberties should not be compromised.
- There is political unwillingness to allow direct top to top communication between intelligence agencies like RAW, ISI which some security experts believe, if allowed, can be an huge step towards ensuring nation's security.

# Organised crime

</div>



[[03-12-2021-Friday\|03-12-2021-Friday]]  9:22 AM

# LINKAGES OF ORGANIZED CRIME WITH TERRORISM
>Organized crime involves centralized criminal groups, operating at international, national, or local levels, that engage in illegal activities such as money laundering, drug and arms trafficking, human trafficking, counterfeiting, and cybercrimes. These activities are primarily motivated by financial gain. #definition 

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



>Terrorism is an act of disproportionate use of violence which create fear in the society, that ultimately helps to achieve a political, ideological or religious objective. #definition #introduction 

</div></div>

>Terrorism and organised crimes ([[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]], drug trade, weapons trade, human trafficking, fake currency) are **conjoint twins** that pose a great threat to the world through their syndicate and their deadly effects. #introduction 
- Till cold war OC and the Terrorism existed in separate spheres. Now they are metamorphing to interrelated single entity as terrorism require funds by illegal drugs and arms trade.
## Types of organised crimes
Organised crimes can be classified into two categories
- Traditional OC: includes illicit liquor trade, kidnapping, gambling, betting, robbery, sand mafia, mining mafia, contract killing, prostitution etc.
	- Traditional OC is based on power over local community, its mostly a family organisation.
- Non-traditional OC: includes trans-national crimes like [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]], pumping of fake Indian currencies, Hawala transfer, Cybercrimes, human trafficking, arms smuggling, drug smuggling etc.

## Difference between terrorism & OC
|Terrorism| Organised Crime|
---------------|---------------
Political/ Ideological objectives| Economic Objectives
Aims to destabilise the government| Runs parallel with a favorable government
Primarily aimed at violence| Prefer nonviolence, often resort to violence

## Similarities between terrorism & OC
- Both use extreme violence and the threat of reprisals. The violent activities include use of kidnappings, assassinations, and extortion.
- Both operate secretly, though at times publicly in friendly territory.
- Both defy the state and the [[Rule of law\|rule of law]]. They present great security threat to the nations.
- Both are highly adaptable, innovative, and resilient.
- They both have provided social services, though this is much more frequently seen with terrorist groups.
## Factors that created nexus 
- End of [[Cold War\|Cold War]]: Terrorists had to find new ways for finance following the reduction in state financing for terrorist/insurgent movements.
- Communication revolution: Cyberspace act as a common platform for terror organisations and organised crimes to flourish.
- [[GS 1/SOCIETY/EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION ON INDIAN SOCIETY\|Globalisation]]: Removal of barriers and free movement of goods, services and people.
- Global war on terror: Crackdown on terror financing (mostly state sponsored) led to closer cooperation between terrorist organisations and crime syndicates.

## Organized Crime and Terrorism: The Black Hole syndrome
- A black hole is a **lawless enclave**, created as a result of the convergence of OC and terrorism, gaining economic and political control over a territory or an entire state.
- **Black Hole Syndrome** occurs when the primary motivation of the group engaged in civil war shift from political aims to criminal gains and when the state has been taken over by a crime terror group.

## Linkages
![Pasted image 20220919014029.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220919014029.png)
- Money through money laundering is used to fund the terror organisations. 
	- Hawala transactions of real estate in India are said to be used by terror groups in Pakistan to fund its activities.
- Drug trafficking started as an organised crime and has emerged as a threat to nation states because of its association with terrorist groups. Narcotics + Terrorism = Narco-Terrorism 
	- ==Taliban in Afghanistan is reportedly making some $100 million a year from drugs.== Terrorists give protection and support to drug traffickers with fire arms, and the drug traffickers, being acquainted with the routes, assist the terrorists in border crossings.
- Large amount of illegal small arms are manufactured in various illegal arms factories in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and sold on the black market for cheap prices. The illegal arms trafficking aids terrorists operating around the world.
- Terrorist organisations not only utilise human trafficking for financial support, they also use to obtain an entry point into countries. The slave trade is currently a multi billion industry built on demand for single product i.e. fellow human beings.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention#Menace of counterfeit money\|Currency counterfeiting]] is one of the organised white collar crimes which has assumed serious proportions in growing terrorism globally. Beyond issues of intellectual property theft and consumer safety, there is the notion that counterfeit sales directly fund terrorist organisations.
- Hybrid organisations: Displaying both the characteristics of a crime syndicate and terrorist organisation. e.g. *Republican Armed Forces of Columbia*.
## Factors which contributed to this
- Alleged political nexus between the politicians and various groups all over the world.
	- e.g., Wagner group (a private military company (PMC)) and alleged nexus with Putin's government in Russia.
- Corporates fund the terror groups indirectly as it help them to expand their business via arms trade, drug trade, oil production and post war facilities.
- Poor performance of global police forces like Interpol in curbing this linkage.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|Money laundering]], human trafficking goes unchallenged as regulations and laws are not very effective.
- Regional instability, religious propaganda further fuel these linkages. e.g. [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Role of external state and non state actors in creating challenges to internal security#Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan Security of India\|Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan]]
- Poor national law and order situations and lack of control over cyberspace leaves gaps in the security field.

## Impacts of nexus between terrorism and OC
### On government/state
- Fall or failure of state
- Governance failure
- Corrupt government
- Narco-state
- Loss of revenue
- Trade imbalance
- Reduced GDP
- Low investment and tourist inflow
- Shift in power to terror groups

### Society
- Erosion of trust in government
- More exposure to crime and violence
- High risk environment - pollution, riots
- Illegal human trafficking
- Drug addiction
- Health issues like HIV

### Global security
- Protracted war
- Fragile states
- Spike in illegal trade
- Less access to resources
- Migration
- Reduction in global GDP, investment etc.
- Economic disparity

## Way forward
- **There is a need for global cooperation in curbing the nexus.**
	- Stricter norms by UAE for sourcing gold - move aimed at preventing both [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|Money laundering]] and terror financing.
	- Interpol led **Operation Pangea XIV** to crackdown fake medicines.
- **Adequate training and use of data analytics and artificial intelligence** monitoring tools to monitor socially harmful developments.
- **Increase efforts to integrate policy towards terrorism and organized crime:** enhance governments investigative and response capabilities; training focused on critical skills and exchange of skills between and among the nations.
	- Punjab government set-up a **anti-gangster task force (AGTF)**, a squad formed to eradicate organised crime in the state.  
		- Punjab government will provide requisite manpower, latest equipment and information technology, besides adequate funds "to break the unholy nexus which has already spread its wings in the drug trade and Kabaddi world".
- **Enhance Public Awareness** by sensitising communities and civil societies on the impact of terrorism and eliminate misconceptions through the mass media and other channels

# BASICS OF CYBER SECURITY
>Cyberspace is interconnectedness of IT infrastructure such as Internet, Telecom networks, computer systems etc. #definition 

>Cyber security means securing the cyberspace from attack and economic espionage. Cybersecurity focuses on protecting and defending computer systems, networks, and our digital lives from disruption. #definition #introduction 
- **Cyber is often touted as fifth dimension of warfare** - in addition to land, sea, air and space. ==In cyberspace the domains of military and national security co-exist with the cyber domain of everyday life.==
- Geographical land size or GDP size will be irrelevant in cyber warfare capacity or deterrence.
- Cyber weapons becoming the **weapon of choice** not only during a conflict, but even during peace time. They carry untold capacity to distort systems and structures - both civilian and military. 
- According to the CERT-In Annual Report 2022, there were about 14 lakhs cybersecurity incidents reported in India in 2022. This is a significant increase from the 11.5 lakhs incidents reported in 2021.
- With the rapidly blurring lines between digital and physical realms, every critical infrastructure would be extremely vulnerable to attacks from hostile state and non-state actors.
- In Global Cybersecurity #index 2021 released by the ITU, India ranked 10th, moving from 47th place in 2018. This is a significant improvement, and it reflects India's growing commitment to cybersecurity. #facts 
- ![Pasted image 20220820213229.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220820213229.png)
## Types of Security threats
Majorly there are three types of cyber threats
- Cyber Crimes
- Cyber Terrorism
- Cyber Warfare
### Cyber crimes
Refers to the general crimes that are done in the cyber space. It may include various forms as given below but are not restricted to them alone.
- **Hacking:** Hacking in simple terms means an illegal intrusion into a computer system and/or network or an account. ==White hat hackers are those who perform ethical hacking.== 
	- e.g. PM's twitter account was briefly hacked in December 2021.
- **Cyber defamation:** It is defamation by anything which can be read, seen or heard with the help of computers.
- **Corporate smear:** It is false rumours about a company, its management or its stock that is posted on the Internet. This is bad for business. - **Digital forgery:** Digital forgery implies making use of digital technology to forge a document. It is used to make fakes IDs, cheques, currency, passports, visas, etc.
- **Gambling:** The world of online gambling, due to its anonymity, unfortunately has many other hazards like danger of illegal use of credit card or illegal access to bank account.
- **Sale of illegal articles:** There are certain articles like drugs, guns, pirated software or music that might not be permitted to be sold under the law of a particular country.
- **E-mail spamming:** Spam is an unsolicited message requiring one’s time and effort to get rid off. The result, apart from loss of internet working hours, could be one of mental agony and distress.
- **Child Pornography:** The Internet is extensively used for sexual abuse of children.
- Cyber Stalking: It refers to the use of the internet, e-mail, or any other electronic communication devices to stalk a person.
- Deepfakes: 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Deep fakes add a whole new level of danger to misinformation campaigns. 

</div></div>

- Dissemination of Malicious Software (Malware): “Malware” is short for “malicious software” - computer programs designed to infiltrate and damage computers without the user’s consent.
### Cyber terrorism
- Cyber terrorism is the convergence of [[Threat of terrorism\|Terrorism]] and cyber space. 
- It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attacks against computers, networks, and information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or ideological objectives.
### Cyber warfare
- Cyber warfare is internet based conflict involving politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. 
- It includes trans-national crimes like sabotage leading to economic/political disruptions.
- Cyber warfare attacks can disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems. 
- In 2010, Stuxnet, attacked Iranian nuclear programme.
## Terms Associated with Cyber Security
### Sandboxing
- Sandboxing is a technique in which one creates an isolated test environment, a "sandbox," in which to execute or "detonate" a suspicious file or URL that is attached to an email or otherwise reaches your network and then observe what happens.
- Sandboxes provide another layer of protection against new security threats also called **zero-day threats**.
- "Sandboxes detect malware proactively and also against unseen threats. While traditional security measures act reactively.
### Critical information infrastructure
>Critical information infrastructure is communications or information service whose availability, reliability and resilience are essential to the functioning of a modern economy, security and other essential social values. Critical information sectors in India include Power, ICT/Communication, Banking, Transport and e-governance. #definition 
- The complex interactions among critical infrastructure leads to interdependencies. A minor disruption at one point could have a rippling effect across multiple infrastructures in India.
## Types of cyber attacks 
Cybersecurity attacks are executed using Malwares, viruses, trojans, botnets, ransomwares, phishing including spear phishing, social engineering and Zero-day software's.
### Virus
- A virus is a program that can infect other programs by modifying them to include a possible evolved copy of itself. 
- It normally affects program files, but in some cases, they also affect data files disrupting the use of data and destroying them completely. 
- The vicious cycle of a virus perpetuates as infected emails are forwarded to multiple users. 
- Viruses also spread through shared media, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives.
### Worms
- Unlike viruses, computer worms are malicious programs that copy themselves from system to system, rather than infiltrating legitimate files.
### Botnet
- A botnet is a network of computers infected with malware without the user's knowledge and controlled by cybercriminals. They're typically used to send spam emails, transmit viruses and engage in other acts of cybercrime.
### Trojans
- Trojan is another form of Malware, which do things other than what is expected by the user. Inspired from Trojan Horse of Greek epics.
- They are of different types like backdoor Trojan, data sending Trojan, destructive Trojan etc.
### Hoax
- Hoax is an email that warns the user of a certain system that is harming the computer.
- The message thereafter instructs the user to run a procedure to correct the harming system, thus invading and deleting important files.
### Phishing
- Phishing is the fraudulent act of acquiring private and sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, personal identification and account usernames and passwords. E.g. Lottery winning emails, online financial help offered etc.
### Spamming
- Spamming is the use of electronic messaging systems like e-mails and other digital delivery systems and broadcast media to send unwanted bulk messages indiscriminately.
- Spam advertisers have little to no operating costs and so need only a small response rate to make a profit. Most spam are commercial advertising, but some contain viruses, adware, or scams.
### Malware attacks
- Malware essentially do two things
	- infiltrating a system
	- data exfiltration - stealing of data
- **NetWire** (surfaced in 2012) is one of the most active malware, which gives the control of infected system to the attacker and compromise passwords.
- **Shadowpad** is a backdoor trojan malware.
### Ransomware
- Ransomware attacks literally hold your data for ransom. e.g. **NotPetya** - attack on machines in about 64 countries in 2017, **Wannacry** - attack on National Health Service of UK in 2017, **SolarWinds** - attack on Colonial Pipeline and JBS.
- It is capable of taking down entire fuel pipelines to hijacking hospital networks.
- Ransomware attacks target individual systems, businesses and government institutions.
- Attack can't happen without some access to your system, which is usually achieved through a **rogue application**.
- It can sometimes spread on its own by exploiting security holes in legitimate software that hasn't been properly updated or patched.
- Majority of the firms are unsure of recovery from ransomware: Dell Technologies 2021 Global Data Protection #index (GDPI)
- Disastrous consequences includes
	-  being locked out of your most important files and systems
	-  you also have to pay cash to get access to them again
	-  not sure whether you even get access after paying
- **How to protect data from ransomware attacks**
	- Be cautious about downloading or opening any files from the web or your email if you're not certain of their source.
	- **Update, protect, and back up**. 
		- Regularly update all the applications.
		- Adding third-party software on top keeps you even better protected.
		- Make sure you use strong passwords that are different for all of your accounts (ideally through a password manager) and that you've turned on **two-factor authentication** everywhere.
		- Back up your computer and other devices regularly.
	- Ransomware is a crime, and you can report it to Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agencies.
### Spyware attacks
>Spyware invades a computer and, as its name implies, monitors a user’s activities without user’s consent. #definition 
#### Pegasus Spyware
- Pegasus is a spyware developed by an Israeli group called NSO. It can copy messages that are sent or received, harvest photos and record calls, secretly film through phone's camera or activate the microphone to record conversations. It can know your current and previous locations. 
- Essentially Pegasus virus seeks '**root privileges**' that enable communication with its controllers through an anonymised network and extract almost every information and files.
- **State sponsored terrorism** - state-sponsored cyber-warfare” waged against Indian citizens.
### Zero-day threats
- Zero-day threats are those which has the capability to cripple a system and could lie undetected for a long time. (e.g. **Stuxnet** - which crippled Iran's nuclear enrichment programme)
### Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)
- Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a well coordinated cybersecurity attack achieved by flooding IT networks with superfluous requests to connect and overload the system to prevent legitimate requests being fulfilled.
### Disinformation as a Cybersecurity threat
- Disinformation is a cybersecurity threat, which exploits our inherent cognitive biases and logical fallacies.
- **Cognitive hacking** is a threat from disinformation and computational propaganda. e.g. storming of US capitol, people in UK, Ireland, Belgium, Cyprus etc. burned down 5G towers because they believed it caused the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Deep fakes add a whole new level of danger to misinformation campaigns. ## Need for cyber security
- Government’s digital push: Various programs of government such as Aadhaar, MyGov, Government e-Market, DigiLocker, [[BharatNet\|BharatNet]] etc. are prompting a larger number of citizens, companies and government agencies to transact online.
- Start-ups digital push: India is the third largest hub for technology-driven startups in the world after USA and China.
- Prevent economic loss: ==The estimated cost of cyber-attacks in India stands at $4 billion which is expected to reach $20 billion in the next 10 years.== One in four Indian organisations suffered a ransomware attack in 2021 - higher than the global average of 21%. #facts 
- Increasing internet users: India ranks 3rd in terms of number of internet users after USA and China.
- **Increased Digital usage Post-Covid**
- To protect women and children who are more vulnerable. Women face threats of cyber bullying, online harassment, Child pornography etc.
- The increasing business transaction from tangible assets to intangible assets like Intellectual Property has converted cyberspace from being a mere info space into important commercial space.
- Another concern is that, [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]], be serious crime becomes much simpler through the use of net. Therefore cyberspace needs to be regulated to curb this phenomenon.
## Threats to Indian Cyber Security
  - Digital illiteracy: which makes Indian citizens highly susceptible to cyber fraud, cyber theft, etc.
 - Vulnerability of certain areas:
	 - Cyber criminals are increasingly targeting a nations' health care system and trying to gain access to patients' data.
	 - Lack of awareness and weak policies governing the space make education sector alarmingly vulnerable to cyber threats. Ever since classrooms started operating virtually, students and teachers are more exposed to Cyber risks.
	 - Military, civilian and government infrastructure being constantly targeted.
 - Chinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. e.g. Power outrage in Mumbai, October 2020 due to cyber attack.  - Difficulty to trace: Ransom being received in [[Cryptocurrency#Bitcoin\|bitcoins]] - which is difficult to trace.
 - Substandard devices: In India, majority of devices have inadequate security infrastructure making them susceptible to malware such as recently detected **Saposhi**. There is also rampant use of unlicensed software.
 - Lack of adoption of new technology: For example, in Banking sector, 75% of total Credit and Debit card are based on magnetic strip which are easy to be cloned.
 - Import dependence: Majority electronic devices used in power sector, defence and other critical infrastructure are imported and makes India vulnerable.
 - Trained staff: There are currently around 30,000 cyber security vacancies in India but demand far outstrips supply of people with required skills.
 - Anonymity: Even advanced precision threats carried out by hackers is difficult to attribute to specific actors, state or non-state. Increase in use of [[Dark net\|dark web]] further increases the threat.
 - Lack of coordination among various agencies: Further, Private sector, despite being a major stakeholder in the cyberspace, has not been involved proactively for the security of the same.
 - Other challenges: Include absence of geographical barriers, majority of servers located outside India, etc.

## Impacts of Cyber Security threats
### Social
- Instances of circulation of fake videos have resulted in aggravation of riots.
- The exodus of North East people from Bangalore was resultant of a hoax spread in the cyber world.
- Online [[Radicalisation\|radicalisation]] has resulted in the creation of extremist group.
- Possibility of Burglars using the updates posted in social media.
- Cyberspace is major area that is used as a platform to initiate victim identification for trafficking of women and children.
### Political
- Can be utilized for the easy mobilisation of the people. 
- Cyberspace may be used to take political mileage and political vendetta, thus causing unrest among people.
- Character assassination of opponents
- Political parties spreading fake news.
- Possibility of cyber warfare causing internal issues.
- Snooping by intelligence agencies. 
### Economic
- Ransomware issues like WannaCry may hamper the working of government
- Attack on critical infrastructure - Possibility of Stock exchange crashes. 
- Phishing and pharming can lead to financial loss and thus unrest among people.
- [[Dark net\|Dark net]] is said to be used for terror funding.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]]
### National Security related
- [[[[Radicalisation\|[[Radicalisation]]]]: Extremists group use cyberspace as platform for their recruitment.
	- People who joined into ISIS made use of telegram messenger application.
- Leakage of sensitive data. E.g., Project 75 (Scorpene class submarine data leak)
## Tools to protect against cyber threats
- **Traditional tools:** Use of antivirus, firewalls, strong passwords, secure wi-fi connection, training to netizen, etc. need to be emphasised.
- **Digital signatures:** A digital signature is a technique by which it is possible to secure electronic information in such a way that the ==originator of the information, as well as the integrity of the information, can be verified.==
- **Encryption:** One of the most powerful and important methods for security in computer systems is to encrypt sensitive records and messages in transit and in storage. At present, information and data security plays a vital role in the security of the country, the security of the corporate sector and also of every individual, working for personal benefit.
- **Security audit:** A security audit is a systematic evaluation of the security apparatus of the company. It is to find out the vulnerabilities that an organisation is facing with its IT infrastructure.
- **Cyber forensics:** Cyber forensics is the discovery, analysis, and reconstruction of evidence extracted from any element of computer systems. It gathers digital evidence that is distributed across large-scale, complex networks. #definition 
## Steps taken by India
### Institutional framework
- **National Security Adviser (NSA)** plays a key role in shaping India's cyber policy ecosystem. NSA chairs **National Information Board**, which is the apex body for cross coordination on cybersecurity policy making.
- **National cyber coordination centre (NCCC)** to scan internet traffic coming into the country.
- **National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre** mandated to protect the critical information infrastructure in strategic areas such as air control, nuclear and space.
- National Cybersecurity Coordinator advises [[Prime Minister\|Prime Minister]] in strategic cybersecurity issues.
- **Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)**, is the nodal entity responding to various cybersecurity threats to non-critical infrastructure (under MEITY). 
	- CERT-In enhances the security through proactive action and effective collaboration. 
	- CERT-In is also operating **Cyber Swachhta Kendra**, a Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre. Government inaugurated the new body NIC-CERT to prevent and predict cyber-attacks on government utilities.
- Recently formed **Defence Cyber Agency**, a tri-service command of armed forces to coordinate and control joint cyber operations, and craft India's cyber doctrine, capable of offensive and defensive manoeuvres.
- A new **Cyber and Information Security (CIS)** Division has been created to tackle internet crimes such as cyber threats, child pornography and online stalking. 
- Cyber Warrior Police force has also been established.
- Ministry of Home Affairs - oversees overall coordination and  implementing **Cyber Crime Prevention against Women & Children #scheme**.
- Ministry of External Affairs coordinates India's [[Cyber diplomacy\|Cyber diplomacy]]
- The Cybercrime volunteer framework under the National Cybercrime Ecosystem Management Unit, which is a part of **Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)** #scheme.
- Internet ethics, cyber hygiene as a part of CDAC's National Cybersecurity strategy.
- **Cyber Surakshit Bharat Initiative** to strengthen cyber security ecosystem in India. It is first PPP of its kind and will leverage the expertise of the IT industry in cybersecurity. 
- In an operation that lasted over two months, the Delhi Police Cyber Cell busted a fake loan-cum extortion scam (Chinese nationals involved) of more than ₹500 crore and arrested 22 people from different parts of the country.
#### Flaws in the existing institutional framework
- Lack of effective coordination
- **Outdated systems and processes**
- **Accelerated digital adoption, over a short span of time** with lack of proper development of a back-end cyber security infrastructure, putting a large amount of data at risk.
- **Limited understanding about cyber security** the lack of understanding among the end user, continues to aid in successful cyber-attack instances.
- Overlapping responsibilities and lack of clear institutional boundaries.
- **Social engineering and phishing attacks**
- Poor accountability
- Hardly wired for cyber resilience
- India is yet to clearly articulate a cybersecurity doctrine, like [[India's nuclear doctrine\|India's nuclear doctrine]].
### Legislative and policy measures
- [[Information Technology Act, 2000\|Information Technology Act, 2000]] (amended in 2008) to provide a legal framework for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange, for data access for cybersecurity etc.
- National Cyber Security Policy 2013.
#### National Cyber security Policy, 2013
- In light of the growth of IT sector in the country, the National Cyber Security Policy of India 2013 was announced by Indian Government in 2013 yet its actual implementation is still missing. 
- As a result fields like e-governance and e-commerce are still risky and may require cyber insurance in the near future. To build secure and resilient cyber space.
##### Features cyber security policy, 2013
- Creating a secure cyber ecosystem, generating trust in IT transactions.
- The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) is to be the nodal agency to protect critical infrastructure, while another 24×7 agency, CERT-In, is to coordinate all emergency response and crisis management.
- Creating workforce of 5,00,000 professionals in the field.
- Fiscal benefits for businessman who accepts standard IT practices, etc.
- Indigenous technological solutions need to be developed to reduce reliance on foreign software. Testing of ICT products and certifying them.
- All organisations should designate a CISO and allot a security budget.
- Encourage use of **public key infrastructure (PIK)** for various government services. #pre2020 
- Engage info-sec professionals to assist e-governance initiatives, establish centres of excellence, cyber security concept labs for awareness and skill development etc.
##### Critical analysis of cyber security policy
- The policy mainly covers defensive and responsive measures and makes no mention of the need to develop offensive capability.
- The policy promises to develop a dynamic regulatory framework for technological developments without explaining what this framework would aim to do.
- The policy avoids addressing privacy vs security, censorship vs freedom of speech and use of indigenous security products versus importing vulnerable technology.
- The coordination of cyber security among various sectors of economy remains under the ambit of CERT-In. CERT-In is an civilian agency functions under the department of information technology.
- Most of the cyber crimes are expected to be dealt with by the local police under state government in combination with outside consultants. No efforts are taken to upgrade skills of local police.
- Most of the IT services have migrated to [[Cloud computing\|cloud computing]] now. NCSP is silent on dealing with threats emanating from new technologies. An earlier and constant revision of policy would make it more meaningfully equipped.
- ==CSP fails to address the overreach of state in cyberspace.== Further, with state outsourcing to private companies to build systems for mass surveillance, there is every chance of private data falling into wrong hands.
- Lack of awareness and the absence of culture of cyber security at individual as well as institutional level.
- Lack of trained and qualified manpower to implement the counter measures. We have only 5000 cyber security professionals, where as China has around 5 lakh personnel.
#### National Cyber Security Strategy
- National Cyber Security Strategy was conceptualised by the **Data Security Council of India (DSCI)** headed by *Lt General Rajesh Pant*. The report focused on 21 areas to ensure a safe, secure, trusted, resilient, and vibrant cyberspace for India.
- Centre is yet to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy.
##### Components of the National Cyber Security Strategy
- Large Scale Digitisation of Public Services: Focus on security in the early stages of design in all digitisation initiatives.
- Supply Chain Security: Monitoring and mapping of the supply chain of the Integrated Circuits (ICT) and electronics products.
- Critical Information Infrastructure Protection: Integrating Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) security.
- Digital Payments: Mapping and modelling of devices and platforms deployed, supply chain, transacting entities, payment flows, interfaces and data exchange.
- State-Level Cyber Security: Developing state-level cybersecurity policies, Allocation of dedicated funds.
- Security of Small And Medium Businesses: Developing security standards, frameworks, and architectures for the adoption of the [[Internet of Things (IoT)\|Internet of Things (IoT)]] and industrialisation.
##### Steps suggested in the report
- Budgetary Provisions: A minimum allocation of 0.25% of the annual budget, which can be raised up to 1% has been recommended to be set aside for cyber security.
	- Setting up a  **Fund of Funds for cybersecurity** and providing Central funding to States to build capabilities in the same field.
- Research, Innovation, Skill-Building And Technology Development: Providing investments in deep-tech cyber security innovation.
	- Creation of  a 'cyber security services’ with cadres chosen from the Indian Engineering Services.
- Cyber Insurance
- [[Cyber diplomacy\|Cyber diplomacy]]: Create ‘Cyber envoys’ for the key countries/regions.
- Cybercrime Investigation: Advanced forensic training for agencies to keep up in the age of AI/ML, Blockchain, IoT, Cloud, Automation.
### International Cooperation on Cyber Security
- **Budapest convention on Cybercrime (2001)**: Only binding international instrument. India is not a member of the same.
- Digital Geneva Convention - over 30 global companies have signed a declaration to protect users and customers from cyber breaches, and collaborate with likeminded intergovernmental and state frameworks.
- ==Paris call for trust and Security in Cyberspace== - High level declaration on developing common principles for securing cyberspace.
- **Christchurch call to Action** to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online.
- **Global centre for cyber security:** It was launched by the [[World Economic Forum\|World Economic Forum]] (WEF) to serve as laboratory and early-warning think tank for future cybersecurity scenarios.
- **Cyber diplomacy:** India has entered into cyber security collaborations with countries such as the USA, European Union and Malaysia.
- **Global Conference on Cyberspace 2017**
## Way forward
No readymade solutions to counter cyber attacks. We need defense-in-depth strategy.
- Cybersecurity doctrine
- Cybersecurity must essentially hinge on [[Personal data protection legislation#Personal data protection legislation\|data protection]].
- Improved coordination is needed between government and the private sector.
	- PPP model for cyber security
	- Creation of State and District Computer Emergency Response Teams.
	- Creation of Interstate coordination centre to deal with cybercrimes.
	- Ensuring coherence and coordination between these different actors should be the primary goal of National Cyber Security Strategy.
	- Clearer strategy and greater transparency are the need of the hour to enable a stable and secure cyber ecosystem.
- Education system should impart Cybersecurity hygiene in its curriculum to raise students as digital citizens. 
- Certain behavioural changes needed in cyberspace
	- Never click unsolicited links - **Beware of digital stranger danger**.
	- Only trust websites with HTTPS as URL, instead of HTTP as the S stands for Secure.
	- Use strong PASSWORDS and add another layer of security through enabling phone authentication.

An efficient and strategic cyber security infrastructure can help prevent these instances and save the government, businesses and individuals a lot of time, effort and money and information.

>Cyber security is an important part of our life today. Everything from national critical infrastructure to our basic human rights are dependent on secure cyber world. Hence  Governments are therefore urged to consider policies that support continued growth cyber security. #conclusion 

## Role of AI in cybersecurity
Cybersecurity confronts escalating threats, with AI both revolutionizing defenses against these evolving dangers and creating new challenges.

### AI as a defensive mechanism
- Anomaly detection: Identifies deviations from normal behavior, signaling potential intrusions.
- Malware analysis: Identifies and categorizes malicious software.
- Phishing detection filters: Detects deceptive emails attempting to acquire sensitive information.
- Incident analysis: Expedites incident analysis, identifies root causes, recommends tailored mitigation strategies, proactive threat hunting, and adaptive security configurations.
### Threat Landscape
- Sophisticated Attacks: AI-powered cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, evading traditional security measures.
- Automated Threats: Malicious actors automate attacks like phishing, malware deployment, and social engineering using AI, enhancing scale and efficiency.
- Zero-day Exploits: AI algorithms rapidly identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including emerging technologies, known as zero-day exploits.
### Challenges and Limitations
- Adversarial AI: Hackers can create sophisticated attacks bypassing AI-based defense systems, leading to a constant battle between AI-powered attacks and defenses.
- Ethical Concerns: AI raises ethical concerns regarding data privacy, bias in algorithms, and potential misuse by governments or organizations for surveillance.
### Potential use against India's Internal Security threats
- Critical Infrastructure Protection: AI-based cybersecurity strengthens the protection of critical infrastructure like power grids, transportation systems, and healthcare networks, crucial for internal security.
- Data Protection and Privacy: AI assists in securing sensitive data, ensuring privacy compliance, and preventing unauthorized access or breaches that can compromise internal security.
- Proactive Security Measures: AI enables proactive measures to anticipate internal threats, identifying insider threats and preventing data leaks or sabotage attempts.

AI plays a pivotal role in both perpetuating and countering cyber threats. Embracing AI in cybersecurity is essential for enhancing internal security, but it requires a balanced approach considering ethical implications and regulatory frameworks.

, economic crimes, and other related challenges. India has taken a number of actions and activities in this direction, including passing numerous laws and regulations pertaining to national security, modernising the police force, improving border control, and strengthening the intelligence and security apparatus.

# Linkages between development and spread of extremism
>Extremism is the advocacy or support of extreme action in a particular issue. 
- For instance, Left Wing Extremism (LWE) is a violent armed revolt that seeks to topple the current administration and replace it with one based on Maoist ideals.
- The majority of radical movements and ideologies have ties to developmental problems. Developmental problems such as lack of access to essential resources for a living could be a breeding ground for extremism.
-  The main extremist movements/ideologies that pose a threat to the country's security include [[Left Wing Extremism (LWE)\|Left Wing Extremism (LWE)]], [[Regionalism\|Regionalism]], [[GS 1/SOCIETY/Communalism\|Communalism]], [[Threat of terrorism\|Terrorism]] etc.
## Factors Responsible for Spread of Extremism
The factors responsible for the spread of extremism in India are complex and interconnected, and include social, economic, political, and cultural factors. Here are some of the key factors:
- Religious and cultural differences: Religious and cultural differences have long been a factor in the spread of extremism in India. The country has a diverse population with multiple religions and cultures, and tensions between different groups can often escalate into violence.
- Developmental obstacles: Poverty, unemployment, and marginalization can create conditions for the spread of extremism. Disenfranchised and disaffected individuals may be attracted to extremist ideologies as a means of addressing their grievances.
- Political instability: Political instability, particularly in regions with long-standing conflicts, can fuel the growth of extremist movements. This can occur when the government is unable to address the underlying grievances of the population or provide basic services and infrastructure.
- External influences: External factors such as support from foreign governments or extremist groups can contribute to the spread of extremism in India. These influences can provide funding, weapons, and training to extremist groups, making them more powerful and capable of carrying out attacks.
- Ideological motivations: Ideological motivations such as a desire for independence or a belief in religious supremacy can also drive the spread of extremism in India. This can result in the formation of separatist movements or violent attacks against perceived enemies.
- Social media: The spread of extremist ideologies has been facilitated by the use of social media. Social media platforms can be used to spread extremist propaganda and recruit new members, particularly among disaffected youth.

In summary, the spread of extremism in India is driven by a complex set of factors. 
## Developmental issues as a factor responsible for spread of Extremism
- **Forest policy**: Adivasi communities' natural habitats were designated reserve forests under the [[Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980\|Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980]] in the name of development. Due to restrictions on their rights, early forest dwellers lost access to their land. This sparked extremist behaviour.
- **Land alienation**: **40% of rural households have no land or less than half acre of land**, increased marginal land holdings, no land reforms, insecurity and exploitation of tenants and unrest leading to extremism.
- **SEZ**: Land acquisition for SEZ again deprived poor of their lands. Also led to loss of revenue in the form of taxes. Loss of food production as huge block of productive lands acquired for SEZ; major impact in livelihood resource, leading to conflict.
- Common Property Resources (CPR): CPR’s contributes effectively to the rural economy and provides sustenance to local communities. CPR includes such as community pasture, watershed drainage, village tanks etc. But due to industrialisation, privatisation and development projects, the CPRs area is shrinking and government never look in to this matter.
- Delayed process of adjudication: Considerable frustration gets built up in the society when conflicts and disputes are not settled in time because of formal and slow judicial system which ends up with illegal extremist mind framework.
- **Rehabilitation**: Displacement or forced eviction of people occur due to developmental projects. Tribal people are most prone to displacement because tribal areas are rich in mineral resources such as Odisha, Jharkhand. This impacts multidimensional trauma on them leading to serious consequences.
- **Unemployment**: High poverty, unemployment and insecurity of livelihood which lead to anger, dissatisfaction amongst youth of extremist affected area.
- [[Environmental Degradation FOC\|Environmental Degradation]]: Land targeted for mineral extraction, agriculture land getting barren, water and air pollution degrade the quality of life.
- Moreover, tourism industry in this development scenario is posing a great threat to the existing tribal life which is interwoven with ecology. The introduction of foreign influence and commercialisation is triggering the process of disintegration of tribal society leading to extremist activities.

Addressing these underlying issues through targeted development programs, political reforms, and interfaith dialogues can help reduce the growth of extremism in India.

## Developmental solutions to problem of Extremism
- [[Panchayat extension act (PESA)\|PESA]], [[MGNREGA\|MGNREGA]], Scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers acts must be implemented in letter and spirit. Gram Sabhas must be granted more powers.
- Land tribunals or fast track courts must be set up for speedy disposal of land ceiling cases. The loopholes in the respective state ceiling laws must be corrected.
- Government should strengthen the subsidiary and supportive activities in horticulture, poultry, fisheries, animal husbandry under the strict guidelines of ministry of agriculture through establishment of quality infrastructure and efficient market linkages at the village level.
- Universalise basic social services to standards amongst the people of extremist affected areas so that the discriminatory manifestations of governance can be removed.
- Since problems in formulating a counter-extremist policy as well as in dealing with the issue on a day-to-day basis are sourced to the lack of centre-state cooperation, **a permanent institutional mechanism** in the form of a **coordination centre** can be established to thrash out emerging differences.
## Other measures required to curb extremism
- Increased developmental expenditure and activities, creation of infrastructure resources and employment generation through development of industries and tourism. Steps from both the public and private sector are required for the desired results.
- With nearly 99 per cent of its borders shared with other countries, the Northeast can be a bridge to a most dynamic neighbourhood beyond the meeting point of South and Southeast Asia. So, we need to liberalise the cross border trade.
- Improved political representation in India’s Parliament. ==The collective strength of the Northeast States in the Lok sabha is 24 in a 543 member house, and this has led to a neglect of issues relating to this region.== Bringing the extremists into mainstream can be done as Rajiv Gandhi Govt did it in case of **Mizo National Front** in Mizoram.
- Restoration and strengthening of institutions of local self-governance, including strong village and tribal councils. Restoration of the integrity of governance, and the various institutions of civil governance, including justice administration.
- ==Disruption of the underground economy of terrorism.== The lucrative regime of collusion between terrorists and various overground entities, including political parties, the bureaucracy and business organisations must be challenged and dismantled.
- ==Better surrender policy should be adopted.== Better coordination with neighbouring countries and information exchange regarding extremist’s activities is very crucial.
- Use of satellite imaging and drone technology can help in monitoring the extremist activities.
- There must be active promotion of a culture of peace that rejects and delegitimises political violence as a means to the resolution of political problems or grievances.

>Development is a useful tool against extremism but it must operate in tandem with the security forces. #conclusion 

</div></div>
 was not properly studied or addressed by the policies to curb extremism in the past. Development and extremism have been linked to each other in a complex manner. The lack of development led to extremist means being adopted by the common people to assert their rights.

# Role of external state and non state actors in creating challenges to internal security
India, has had to deal with several security threats to its internal security from external state and non-state actors. These actors often play a crucial role in creating and exacerbating the internal security challenges that India faces.

>State actors refer to those **entities which have formal backing of a sovereign state** for carrying out any intended action. Examples of state actors are the army, bureaucracy, intelligence agencies etc. #definition 

>Non-state actors are individuals or organisations that have economic, political or social power but do not belong to any particular country or state. They include NGOs, MNCs, religious outfits, Mafias, terrorist groups etc. They may work in tandem for the peace, stability and development of a country or they may work against the state. #definition 

Both state and non-state factors from outside have created problems in our internal security framework. Hence while it is imperative to guard our borders and strengthen our diplomacy, on the other hand, we need to check the various non state actors who come in hidden forms.
## External state actors
- Countries surrounding India have been actively exploiting the volatile situation presented by the turmoil in the northeast. 
	- Not only countries such as China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, but also smaller powers such as Bhutan and Nepal have been involved in the region.
	- Insurgency:
		- North-East suffers from violent movements based upon ethnic identities leading to clashes. China is alleged to support such acts for instance. United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) members of Assam were given shelter by China.
- The state may carry out a limited war against Indian state and this might have ramifications for our internal security.
	- There have been instances where state actors have been responsible for carrying out a limited cyber warfare through hacking and other espionage. e.g. 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



 - Chinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. e.g. Power outrage in Mumbai, October 2020 due to cyber attack. 

</div></div>

- Influencing India's internal politics: Use of propaganda and disinformation campaigns to influence public opinion and create unrest. This has become a significant concern for India in recent years, given the increasing use of social media and the spread of fake news.
	- 50 percent of tweets in connection with the case of violence at Koregaon-Bhima in Maharashtra in 2018 originated from Pakistan.
	- They might support the various insurgent groups, Naxalites, or separatist groups through funding, training or logistics which might pose a threat to our internal security. e.g. Pakistan’s ISI.
- Terrorism: Countries such as Pakistan have been accused of providing support to terrorist organizations that operate in India, and have been alleged to fund and train these groups. 

>Through political backing, economic assistance, logistic support, military training or arms supplies, external state actors have varyingly contributed to the internal security challenges in the country. 
## Non-state actors
- Non-state actors from the neighbouring country have been carrying out a proxy war since decades in order to bleed India to death. e.g. Jihadis
- Certain NGOs and so called civil society organizations also work in a **clandestine manner** to provoke discontent sections of Indian society which creates internal security issues. e.g. Protests against nuclear plants.
	- They can also incite people for [[Regionalism\|regionalism]] thus demanding their separate state which further increases secessionist tendency.
	- Support for Khalistan movement from countries like UK and Canada
- Various dubious non-state actors run fake currency rackets which pose a challenge to the economic security of India.
	- It corrodes economy from inside, by facilitating black money and money laundering activities as well as funding terrorism, which itself creates a demand for fake currency, thereby creating a positive feedback loop. This is the issue arising especially from Pakistan.
- Various organised crime syndicates have been running drug rackets which also create internal security issues through the illicit flow of money.
- Non state actor-sponsored terrorism, often motivated by fundamentalist ideologies, backed by secretive but efficient financial networks, use of IT, clandestine access to chemical-biological and nuclear materials, and illicit drug trafficking, has emerged as a major threat to international stability.
	- Non-state actors like terrorist groups for instance Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad are a continuous threat.
	- Transnational terror networks such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have attempted to radicalize Indian youth and have used social media to spread their ideology.
	- These groups aim to not only create instability in states like J&K, they also have a larger aim of destabilising the country. This is done through sporadic terrorist strikes, which spreads terror and panic. This could also adversely affect the ability of the Indian state to pursue economic modernisation.
- Drug trafficking
	- Inter and Intra state trafficking takes place, through golden crescent and golden triangle routes.
	- Drugs from Golden Crescent (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) have affected Punjab and Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar and Thailand) has affected North Eastern states.
- Human-trafficking:
	- Children and women trafficking takes place via Bangladesh and Nepal.
- [[GS 1/SOCIETY/Communalism\|Communalism]]
	- Propagandas are run and funded by enemy country and other non-state actors (NGOs and CSOs) to destabilize India by damaging the socio-religious fabric and ensure riots.
- Cyber Security
	- Recent cyber-attacks by Legion, ATM skimming are examples. Pakistani hackers often hack government websites.

>The role of external state and non-state actors in creating challenges to internal security in India is significant. India needs to take a comprehensive approach to deal with these threats, including strengthening its border security, enhancing its counter-terrorism capabilities, and working with its international partners to tackle these issues. #conclusion 

## Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan & Security of India
The Taliban’s return to power has caused a major diplomatic setback for India, it now being one of the region’s “most disadvantaged” players.
### Challenges for India
- Indian interests in Afghan: The key concern and challenge is the protection of the investment that India has made in Afghanistan. The challenges range from securing its development infrastructures to safely evacuating Indians stranded in troubled Afghanistan.
- Pakistan’s destabilizing role in Afghanistan: Pakistan sees Afghanistan as potentially providing strategic depth against India. 
- Spread of International Terrorism: For India, a bigger challenge will be about the Taliban’s renewed support for international terrorism and Pakistan’s re-direction of jihadi groups that have allegedly fought with the Taliban towards India. Presence of other groups like ISIS and Haqqani Network and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP).
- Religious Fundamentalism: Like all radical groups, the Taliban will have trouble balancing its religious ideology with the imperatives of state interests. India faces a challenge to deradicalise the region for long lasting peace and stability. It might increase the [[Radicalisation\|radicalisation]] tendencies in J&K and PoK regions.
- New Regional Geopolitical Developments: There can be new regional geopolitical alignments (such as China-Pakistan-Taliban) which may go against the interests of India.
- Organised crimes: Opium trade, Drug trafficking since Afghanistan is a part of golden crescent.
- Illegal migration: to India from Afghanistan
### India's response
- Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan composed of National Security Advisors’ (NSA) of regional countries and chaired by the Indian NSA. It adopted **Delhi Declaration** which focus on
	- Secure and Stable Afghanistan
	- Commitment from Regional countries to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in Afghanistan
	- Collective cooperation against the menace of radicalization, extremism, separatism and drug trafficking in the region
	- Central Role of UN
	- Ensuring Fundamental Rights of the people
- India raised the issue of Afghanistan’s future following the takeover by the Taliban in G20.
- In the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures (CICA) meeting held in in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, India underscored the importance of the Taliban regime meeting the expectations of the international community as elaborated in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593.
### Way forward
- Engaging with Taliban: Talking to the Taliban would allow India to seek security guarantees from the insurgents in return for continued development assistance or other pledges as well as explore the possibility of the Taliban’s autonomy from Pakistan.
- Inclusive Government: The solution comes only through the formation of an inclusive government with the participation of all ethnic groups.
- ==India should prevent Taliban regime from being a pawn of Pakistan.== Make sure that Pak-based anti-India terrorist group do not get support from Taliban.
- Engaging with other players.
	- Chinese cooperation: India should talk with China, with the objective of finding a political settlement and lasting stability in Afghanistan.
	- Russian Support: Russia has cultivated links with the Taliban in recent years. India would need Russia’s support in any form of direct engagement with the Taliban.
- Broader Diplomatic Engagement: India should consider appointing a special envoy dedicated to Afghanistan. The envoy can ensure that Indian views are expressed at every meeting and broaden engagement with the Taliban.
- Global Cooperation: No major power would like to see Afghanistan re-emerge as a global sanctuary of terror.
- Leverage Indian Infrastructural Developments: India should not stop the development work in Afghanistan and continue the good work.

India has to work with Taliban and other regional powers to protect its interests and stabilise Afghanistan. Establishing informal links with the Taliban government would put New Delhi in a stronger position to ensure that its assets and investments in Afghanistan aren’t imperiled. If India remains active and patient too, many opportunities could open up in the new Afghan phase.

# Challenges to internal security through communication networks

>Networks used for information sharing are known as communication networks.  #definition #introduction 

>Communication networks are a part of our critical information infrastructure which was defined in the [[Information Technology Act, 2000\|Information Technology Act, 2000]] as “the computer resource, the incapacitation or destruction of which, shall have debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety.”  

- Communication networks in India refer to the various means and channels through which people can communicate with each other. These networks include:
	- Telecommunications networks: These networks include fixed-line telephone networks, mobile phone networks, and internet service providers.
	- Broadcasting networks: These networks include radio and television broadcasting networks.
	- Social media and messaging networks: These networks include social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.
	- E-commerce networks: These networks include online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart and payment networks like Paytm and Google Pay.
	- Cloud computing networks: These networks provide computing resources, storage, and applications over the internet.
	- Internet of Things (IoT) networks: These networks connect devices like smart homes, smart cities, and wearables to the internet.
## Importance of communication networks
- Communication networks are crucial to the connectivity of other critical infrastructure, viz. civil aviation, shipping, railways, power, nuclear, oil and gas, finance, banking, communication, information technology, law enforcement, intelligence agencies, space, defence, and government networks. 
- In less than two decades, advances in information and communications technologies have revolutionized government, scientific, educational, and commercial infrastructures.
- Powerful personal computers, high-bandwidth and wireless networking technologies, and the widespread use of the Internet have transformed stand-alone systems and predominantly closed networks into a virtually seamless fabric of interconnectivity.
- The types of devices that can connect to this vast information technology (IT) infrastructure have multiplied to include not only fixed wired devices but mobile wireless ones. 
- A growing percentage of access is through always-on connections, and users and organizations are increasingly interconnected across physical and logical networks, organizational boundaries, and national borders.

==Therefore, threats can be both through the networks as well as to the networks.==
## Challenges
Securing the networks is complicated by a number of factors. 
- In the first instance, ==much of the hardware and software that make up the communications ecosystem is sourced externally==; as a case in point, Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and ZTE have supplied about 20 per cent of telecommunications equipment while Indian manufacturers have about 3 per cent of the market. 
- The ==increasing complexity of IT systems and networks==, which will present mounting security challenges for both the providers and consumers.
- As recent incidents have shown, foreign governments are taking advantage of the market penetration and dominance of their companies to infiltrate and compromise telecommunications networks of other countries. ==This is a potent combination of expertise and resources.==
- The task of securing the networks is also complicated by the fact that ==much of the infrastructure is in the hands of private companies== who see measures such as security auditing and other regulations and frameworks as adding to their costs. 
- The ==evolving nature of the telecommunications infrastructure==, as the traditional phone system and IT networks converge into a more unified architecture.
- The expanding wireless connectivity to individual computers and networks, which increases their exposure to attack. In hybrid or all-wireless network environments, the traditional defensive approach of securing the perimeter is not effective because it is increasingly difficult to determine the physical and logical boundaries of networks.
- The increasing inter-connectivity and accessibility of (and consequently, risk to) computer-based systems that are critical to the country’s economy, including supply chain management systems, financial sector networks, and distributed control systems for factories and utilities.
- The breadth and increasingly global nature of the IT supply chain, which will increase opportunities for subversion from attackers within and outside the country.
## Initiatives taken
- The government in the **National Telecom Policy of 2012** has set a target for domestic production of telecom equipment to meet the Indian telecom sector’s demand to the extent of 60 to 80 per cent by 2020. This policy aims to reduce India's reliance on foreign telecom equipment suppliers and promote the growth of the domestic telecom equipment manufacturing industry.
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- India excluded, Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE in 5G trails. We cannot have bloodshed on border, good relationship in other domains : External Affairs Minister. 

</div></div>

- The **Ministry of Communications and Information Technology** has also repeatedly urged telecom companies to take note of vulnerabilities in their equipment and told them they would be held responsible and subject to penalties if the vulnerabilities are not addressed. 
- A number of other measures, such as making local certification mandatory, have been announced.
	- To be effective from December 1, 2020,  power cords, cord sets, plugs and sockets must carry the Mark of Conformity (product approval mark) which has been established by the Central Government of India through the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act (2016), BIS Rules 2018, and BIS Conformity Assessment Regulations (2018)
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Various security forces, agencies and their mandate#NATGRID\|NATGRID]]

## Way forward
- Domestic production of critical equipment of communication network through [[Make in India\|Make in India]], [[PLI\|PLI]] scheme etc.
- Investment in research and development in securing communication network.
- International cooperation in developing state of the art communication networks ahead of attack technology.

>There is a need for a more integrated and strategic approach to securing the networks since they are so crucial to the economic, social and political well-being of the country. #conclusion

# Role of media and social networking sites in internal security challenges
>Media is the 4th pillar of democracy. Any communication channel through which any kind of information, news, entertainment, education, data, promotional messages etc., can be disseminated is called media. #definition #introduction 
- Centralised media sources are those where the information comes through a single source or the flow of information is controlled from a single point. They can be regulated if required. E.g., Newspaper, Visual Media, Publications etc.
- Decentralised media sources are called so since their exchange information from multiple sources and are unregulated. They are not easy to regulate. E.g., Social Media.
- The boundaries between traditional media and modern media are clearly blurring. Andrew Chadwick (Loughborough University) posited the theory of “The Hybrid Media System” in the context of political communication and argued that it is time we let go of dichotomous thinking (as old and new media) and embrace an all­ encompassing intermixed and blended media.

## Why media can be dangerous
- In the 26/11 attack, the handlers of the terrorist used the media coverage to tell them the exact locations of the policemen and advised them about the best way to attack the police. Also the goriest details of the attack were shown virtually non-stop.
- India is full of incidents of communal tensions most particularly between Hindus and Muslims. Media is often criticised for its non-stop coverage of these incidents which might incite the communities to further wreak havoc. Even print media sometimes thoughtlessly carries messages from the leaders of opposing factions creating further tensions.
- During 2013 Assam riots, social media and the SMS were blamed for rumour mongering during the Assam unrest. They were alleged of misrepresentation of facts and doctoring news which led to huge migration of north easterners across the country.
- Also the media networks are regularly hacked by enemy countries to spread false information and to recover classified data. Recently New York Times (NYT) and Twitter servers were hacked by Syrian agencies.
- Countries like US are not only snooping on their own citizens but are also able to freely intrude the privacy of any individual in other countries too. US has the specific advantage of having the servers of main social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter etc. within its frontiers and hence in the outreach of their laws.
## Possible ways to plug the shortcomings of media
- Sensitising journalists about the possible effects of non-stop display of gory images during coverage of riots, terrorist affected areas etc.
- Preparing guidelines for the coverage of areas affected by  natural and man-made disasters. Ex: Indian media in during Nepal [[GS 1/GEOGRAPHY/GEOPHYSICAL PHENOMENA/EARTHQUAKE\|earthquake]].
	- Indian media’s alleged insensitive and biased coverage of Nepal earthquake has come in for severe criticism, with GoHomeIndianMedia hashtag 	- ![Pasted image 20220911134300.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220911134300.png)
- Building solid networks and creating a task force to combat any kind of hacking.

## Social media & Internal security challenges
>Social media is fast becoming a double-edged sword in the internal security regime. The potential of threats to internal security emanating from various forms like Cyber Terrorism, Fraud, crime, spreading violence, etc. are immense.  #introduction 
- Media is a source of information consumption but SM is a platform for expression. In SM people are authors, content creators and participants.
- Various external state and non-state actors are using various social media platforms to spread propaganda globally, including in India.

### Types of Social Media
- Collaborative project - Wikipedia
- Blog, micro-blog  - Twitter
- Content communities - YouTube
- Social Networking site - Facebook
- Virtual game world - world of warcraft
- Virtual social world - Metaverse
### Internal security threats emanating from social medias
- **Propagating fundamentalism:** Social media due to its increasing penetration has become a tool for propagating fundamentalism. The extremists and fundamentalist groups are using social media as a tool for propagating communal violence and spreading unrest in the society. e.g. **Daesh** has been using Internet to spread its propaganda using platforms such as twitter, YouTube etc.
	- ISIS (Daesh): a militant Islamist organization, formed in the early 21st century, whose aim is to create a caliphate in the Middle East and North Africa.
- **Terrorism and Radicalization of youth:** The unregulated social media websites become relatively safer points of contacts for these terrorist organizations. Various terrorist organizations like ISIS are increasingly using social media for new recruitments. e.g., Propaganda information to recruit for terror groups like AQIS, LeT on telegram have been intercepted by NIA.
	- **Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent** usually abbreviated as AQIS, is an Islamist militant organization which aims to fight the governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh in order to establish an Islamic state.
- **Cyber Terrorism:** Terrorists select Social Media as a practical alternative to disturb the function of nations and other business activities because this technique has potential to cause huge damage.
- **Fake news:** The rapid spread of false information/fake news through social media is among the emerging risks identified by the World Economic Forum in its various reports. Ex: Mob lynching due to spread of fake news.
	- The Information & Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry has blocked seven Indian and one Pakistan based YouTube news channels for allegedly spreading disinformation related to India’s national security, foreign relations and public order. 
- **Platform without boundaries:** The social media platform has no limitations of national boundaries. This has led to external agents interfering in domestic affairs.
- **Social media and religious intolerance:** The propagation of fake history and fake news spreading is hampering the social fabric of the country. Propagation of [[Hate speech\|hate speech]] is easily being done through social media.
- Criminal Activity and Money laundering.
- **Hacking:** By using Social Media hackers breach the national security and steal important data of defence or other strategic sectors. This can kneel the whole country without using Arms and Ammunition.
- **Influence the outcome of elections:** e.g. Alleged Facebook role in US elections.
- Targeted advertisements by companies and political parties.
- Hate against women and minorities.
- Privacy issues. [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity#Pegasus Spyware\|Pegasus spyware]]
### Measures by the government
- Social Media Communication Hub - to monitor social media.
- Network Traffic Analysis (NETRA) - to detect selective words.
- Lawful interception and Monitoring Project (LIM) - For surveillance.
- [[Information Technology Act, 2000#IT Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules 2021\|IT Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code Rules 2021]]
### Ways through which government can address the challenge of social media
- **Cooperation between countries:** e.g. **Christchurch Call to Action** to combat online extremism initiated by the governments of France and New Zealand along with top social media companies after the Christchurch attacks.
- **Digital Education:** The lack of digital literacy has led to people falling prey to social media manipulations and agenda of vested interests. Digital education of people should be done to make people aware of the ill effects of social media. It can help to prepare people in securing from falling prey to the agenda of vested interests.
- **Strengthening cyber intelligence:** [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]] ambit needs to be expanded to involve cyber intelligence. Utilizing artificial intelligence and Big data analysis for tracking criminal activities in cyberspace.
- **Accountability on social media platforms:** Social media platforms are benefiting from user traffic. They must be brought under the regulatory regimes and made accountable to security regimes and national governments.
- **Smart policing:** Digital training of police must be done to better equip them against online threats and instances of cyberterrorism. e.g. **Cyberdome in Kerala**
- **Strengthening the existing infrastructure:** e-Surveillance Projects: National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID), CERT-In, Central Monitoring System (CMS), Internet Spy System Network and Traffic Analysis System (NETRA), National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) etc.
- **TK Viswanathan** #committee recommends replacing some clauses of IT Act and amending some IPC sections like section 153. It also recommends the appointment of state cyber coordinator, district cyber-crime cell.
- Institutionalizing the blueprint of **National Social Media #policy** to monitor and regulate social media for security threats.
- Taking social media giants on board to tackle the use of social media for criminal and anti-national activities.
- ==Experts have suggested India to build our own social networks like the way China has its own.==
- Proper netiquette should be followed by netizens.
	- Netiquette is a set of unofficial rules for good behavior and politeness followed by users of online and digital technologies such as the Internet, email, and chatrooms.


However, some challenges in monitoring social media such as Server Location and Laws of Different Countries, Encrypted Message and Anonymity, etc. hinder this. The national governments must update their security apparatus to fight the menace.

# BASICS OF CYBER SECURITY
>Cyberspace is interconnectedness of IT infrastructure such as Internet, Telecom networks, computer systems etc. #definition 

>Cyber security means securing the cyberspace from attack and economic espionage. Cybersecurity focuses on protecting and defending computer systems, networks, and our digital lives from disruption. #definition #introduction 
- **Cyber is often touted as fifth dimension of warfare** - in addition to land, sea, air and space. ==In cyberspace the domains of military and national security co-exist with the cyber domain of everyday life.==
- Geographical land size or GDP size will be irrelevant in cyber warfare capacity or deterrence.
- Cyber weapons becoming the **weapon of choice** not only during a conflict, but even during peace time. They carry untold capacity to distort systems and structures - both civilian and military. 
- According to the CERT-In Annual Report 2022, there were about 14 lakhs cybersecurity incidents reported in India in 2022. This is a significant increase from the 11.5 lakhs incidents reported in 2021.
- With the rapidly blurring lines between digital and physical realms, every critical infrastructure would be extremely vulnerable to attacks from hostile state and non-state actors.
- In Global Cybersecurity #index 2021 released by the ITU, India ranked 10th, moving from 47th place in 2018. This is a significant improvement, and it reflects India's growing commitment to cybersecurity. #facts

## Types of Security threats
Majorly there are three types of cyber threats
- Cyber Crimes
- Cyber Terrorism
- Cyber Warfare
### Cyber crimes
Refers to the general crimes that are done in the cyber space. It may include various forms as given below but are not restricted to them alone.
- **Hacking:** Hacking in simple terms means an illegal intrusion into a computer system and/or network or an account. ==White hat hackers are those who perform ethical hacking.== 
	- e.g. PM's twitter account was briefly hacked in December 2021.
- **Cyber defamation:** It is defamation by anything which can be read, seen or heard with the help of computers.
- **Corporate smear:** It is false rumours about a company, its management or its stock that is posted on the Internet. This is bad for business. - **Digital forgery:** Digital forgery implies making use of digital technology to forge a document. It is used to make fakes IDs, cheques, currency, passports, visas, etc.
- **Gambling:** The world of online gambling, due to its anonymity, unfortunately has many other hazards like danger of illegal use of credit card or illegal access to bank account.
- **Sale of illegal articles:** There are certain articles like drugs, guns, pirated software or music that might not be permitted to be sold under the law of a particular country.
- **E-mail spamming:** Spam is an unsolicited message requiring one’s time and effort to get rid off. The result, apart from loss of internet working hours, could be one of mental agony and distress.
- **Child Pornography:** The Internet is extensively used for sexual abuse of children.
- Cyber Stalking: It refers to the use of the internet, e-mail, or any other electronic communication devices to stalk a person.
- Deepfakes: 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Deep fakes add a whole new level of danger to misinformation campaigns. 

</div></div>

- Dissemination of Malicious Software (Malware): “Malware” is short for “malicious software” - computer programs designed to infiltrate and damage computers without the user’s consent.
### Cyber terrorism
- Cyber terrorism is the convergence of [[Threat of terrorism\|Terrorism]] and cyber space. 
- It is generally understood to mean unlawful attacks and threats of attacks against computers, networks, and information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or ideological objectives.
### Cyber warfare
- Cyber warfare is internet based conflict involving politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. 
- It includes trans-national crimes like sabotage leading to economic/political disruptions.
- Cyber warfare attacks can disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems. 
- In 2010, Stuxnet, attacked Iranian nuclear programme.
## Terms Associated with Cyber Security
### Sandboxing
- Sandboxing is a technique in which one creates an isolated test environment, a "sandbox," in which to execute or "detonate" a suspicious file or URL that is attached to an email or otherwise reaches your network and then observe what happens.
- Sandboxes provide another layer of protection against new security threats also called **zero-day threats**.
- "Sandboxes detect malware proactively and also against unseen threats. While traditional security measures act reactively.
### Critical information infrastructure
>Critical information infrastructure is communications or information service whose availability, reliability and resilience are essential to the functioning of a modern economy, security and other essential social values. Critical information sectors in India include Power, ICT/Communication, Banking, Transport and e-governance. #definition 
- The complex interactions among critical infrastructure leads to interdependencies. A minor disruption at one point could have a rippling effect across multiple infrastructures in India.
## Types of cyber attacks 
Cybersecurity attacks are executed using Malwares, viruses, trojans, botnets, ransomwares, phishing including spear phishing, social engineering and Zero-day software's.
### Virus
- A virus is a program that can infect other programs by modifying them to include a possible evolved copy of itself. 
- It normally affects program files, but in some cases, they also affect data files disrupting the use of data and destroying them completely. 
- The vicious cycle of a virus perpetuates as infected emails are forwarded to multiple users. 
- Viruses also spread through shared media, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives.
### Worms
- Unlike viruses, computer worms are malicious programs that copy themselves from system to system, rather than infiltrating legitimate files.
### Botnet
- A botnet is a network of computers infected with malware without the user's knowledge and controlled by cybercriminals. They're typically used to send spam emails, transmit viruses and engage in other acts of cybercrime.
### Trojans
- Trojan is another form of Malware, which do things other than what is expected by the user. Inspired from Trojan Horse of Greek epics.
- They are of different types like backdoor Trojan, data sending Trojan, destructive Trojan etc.
### Hoax
- Hoax is an email that warns the user of a certain system that is harming the computer.
- The message thereafter instructs the user to run a procedure to correct the harming system, thus invading and deleting important files.
### Phishing
- Phishing is the fraudulent act of acquiring private and sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, personal identification and account usernames and passwords. E.g. Lottery winning emails, online financial help offered etc.
### Spamming
- Spamming is the use of electronic messaging systems like e-mails and other digital delivery systems and broadcast media to send unwanted bulk messages indiscriminately.
- Spam advertisers have little to no operating costs and so need only a small response rate to make a profit. Most spam are commercial advertising, but some contain viruses, adware, or scams.
### Malware attacks
- Malware essentially do two things
	- infiltrating a system
	- data exfiltration - stealing of data
- **NetWire** (surfaced in 2012) is one of the most active malware, which gives the control of infected system to the attacker and compromise passwords.
- **Shadowpad** is a backdoor trojan malware.
### Ransomware
- Ransomware attacks literally hold your data for ransom. e.g. **NotPetya** - attack on machines in about 64 countries in 2017, **Wannacry** - attack on National Health Service of UK in 2017, **SolarWinds** - attack on Colonial Pipeline and JBS.
- It is capable of taking down entire fuel pipelines to hijacking hospital networks.
- Ransomware attacks target individual systems, businesses and government institutions.
- Attack can't happen without some access to your system, which is usually achieved through a **rogue application**.
- It can sometimes spread on its own by exploiting security holes in legitimate software that hasn't been properly updated or patched.
- Majority of the firms are unsure of recovery from ransomware: Dell Technologies 2021 Global Data Protection #index (GDPI)
- Disastrous consequences includes
	-  being locked out of your most important files and systems
	-  you also have to pay cash to get access to them again
	-  not sure whether you even get access after paying
- **How to protect data from ransomware attacks**
	- Be cautious about downloading or opening any files from the web or your email if you're not certain of their source.
	- **Update, protect, and back up**. 
		- Regularly update all the applications.
		- Adding third-party software on top keeps you even better protected.
		- Make sure you use strong passwords that are different for all of your accounts (ideally through a password manager) and that you've turned on **two-factor authentication** everywhere.
		- Back up your computer and other devices regularly.
	- Ransomware is a crime, and you can report it to Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agencies.
### Spyware attacks
>Spyware invades a computer and, as its name implies, monitors a user’s activities without user’s consent. #definition 
#### Pegasus Spyware
- Pegasus is a spyware developed by an Israeli group called NSO. It can copy messages that are sent or received, harvest photos and record calls, secretly film through phone's camera or activate the microphone to record conversations. It can know your current and previous locations. 
- Essentially Pegasus virus seeks '**root privileges**' that enable communication with its controllers through an anonymised network and extract almost every information and files.
- **State sponsored terrorism** - state-sponsored cyber-warfare” waged against Indian citizens.
### Zero-day threats
- Zero-day threats are those which has the capability to cripple a system and could lie undetected for a long time. (e.g. **Stuxnet** - which crippled Iran's nuclear enrichment programme)
### Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)
- Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) is a well coordinated cybersecurity attack achieved by flooding IT networks with superfluous requests to connect and overload the system to prevent legitimate requests being fulfilled.
### Disinformation as a Cybersecurity threat
- Disinformation is a cybersecurity threat, which exploits our inherent cognitive biases and logical fallacies.
- **Cognitive hacking** is a threat from disinformation and computational propaganda. e.g. storming of US capitol, people in UK, Ireland, Belgium, Cyprus etc. burned down 5G towers because they believed it caused the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Deep fakes add a whole new level of danger to misinformation campaigns. ## Need for cyber security
- Government’s digital push: Various programs of government such as Aadhaar, MyGov, Government e-Market, DigiLocker, [[BharatNet\|BharatNet]] etc. are prompting a larger number of citizens, companies and government agencies to transact online.
- Start-ups digital push: India is the third largest hub for technology-driven startups in the world after USA and China.
- Prevent economic loss: ==The estimated cost of cyber-attacks in India stands at $4 billion which is expected to reach $20 billion in the next 10 years.== One in four Indian organisations suffered a ransomware attack in 2021 - higher than the global average of 21%. #facts 
- Increasing internet users: India ranks 3rd in terms of number of internet users after USA and China.
- **Increased Digital usage Post-Covid**
- To protect women and children who are more vulnerable. Women face threats of cyber bullying, online harassment, Child pornography etc.
- The increasing business transaction from tangible assets to intangible assets like Intellectual Property has converted cyberspace from being a mere info space into important commercial space.
- Another concern is that, [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]], be serious crime becomes much simpler through the use of net. Therefore cyberspace needs to be regulated to curb this phenomenon.
## Threats to Indian Cyber Security
  - Digital illiteracy: which makes Indian citizens highly susceptible to cyber fraud, cyber theft, etc.
 - Vulnerability of certain areas:
	 - Cyber criminals are increasingly targeting a nations' health care system and trying to gain access to patients' data.
	 - Lack of awareness and weak policies governing the space make education sector alarmingly vulnerable to cyber threats. Ever since classrooms started operating virtually, students and teachers are more exposed to Cyber risks.
	 - Military, civilian and government infrastructure being constantly targeted.
 - Chinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. e.g. Power outrage in Mumbai, October 2020 due to cyber attack.  - Difficulty to trace: Ransom being received in [[Cryptocurrency#Bitcoin\|bitcoins]] - which is difficult to trace.
 - Substandard devices: In India, majority of devices have inadequate security infrastructure making them susceptible to malware such as recently detected **Saposhi**. There is also rampant use of unlicensed software.
 - Lack of adoption of new technology: For example, in Banking sector, 75% of total Credit and Debit card are based on magnetic strip which are easy to be cloned.
 - Import dependence: Majority electronic devices used in power sector, defence and other critical infrastructure are imported and makes India vulnerable.
 - Trained staff: There are currently around 30,000 cyber security vacancies in India but demand far outstrips supply of people with required skills.
 - Anonymity: Even advanced precision threats carried out by hackers is difficult to attribute to specific actors, state or non-state. Increase in use of [[Dark net\|dark web]] further increases the threat.
 - Lack of coordination among various agencies: Further, Private sector, despite being a major stakeholder in the cyberspace, has not been involved proactively for the security of the same.
 - Other challenges: Include absence of geographical barriers, majority of servers located outside India, etc.

## Impacts of Cyber Security threats
### Social
- Instances of circulation of fake videos have resulted in aggravation of riots.
- The exodus of North East people from Bangalore was resultant of a hoax spread in the cyber world.
- Online [[Radicalisation\|radicalisation]] has resulted in the creation of extremist group.
- Possibility of Burglars using the updates posted in social media.
- Cyberspace is major area that is used as a platform to initiate victim identification for trafficking of women and children.
### Political
- Can be utilized for the easy mobilisation of the people. 
- Cyberspace may be used to take political mileage and political vendetta, thus causing unrest among people.
- Character assassination of opponents
- Political parties spreading fake news.
- Possibility of cyber warfare causing internal issues.
- Snooping by intelligence agencies. 
### Economic
- Ransomware issues like WannaCry may hamper the working of government
- Attack on critical infrastructure - Possibility of Stock exchange crashes. 
- Phishing and pharming can lead to financial loss and thus unrest among people.
- [[Dark net\|Dark net]] is said to be used for terror funding.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]]
### National Security related
- [[[[Radicalisation\|[[Radicalisation]]]]: Extremists group use cyberspace as platform for their recruitment.
	- People who joined into ISIS made use of telegram messenger application.
- Leakage of sensitive data. E.g., Project 75 (Scorpene class submarine data leak)
## Tools to protect against cyber threats
- **Traditional tools:** Use of antivirus, firewalls, strong passwords, secure wi-fi connection, training to netizen, etc. need to be emphasised.
- **Digital signatures:** A digital signature is a technique by which it is possible to secure electronic information in such a way that the ==originator of the information, as well as the integrity of the information, can be verified.==
- **Encryption:** One of the most powerful and important methods for security in computer systems is to encrypt sensitive records and messages in transit and in storage. At present, information and data security plays a vital role in the security of the country, the security of the corporate sector and also of every individual, working for personal benefit.
- **Security audit:** A security audit is a systematic evaluation of the security apparatus of the company. It is to find out the vulnerabilities that an organisation is facing with its IT infrastructure.
- **Cyber forensics:** Cyber forensics is the discovery, analysis, and reconstruction of evidence extracted from any element of computer systems. It gathers digital evidence that is distributed across large-scale, complex networks. #definition 
## Steps taken by India
### Institutional framework
- **National Security Adviser (NSA)** plays a key role in shaping India's cyber policy ecosystem. NSA chairs **National Information Board**, which is the apex body for cross coordination on cybersecurity policy making.
- **National cyber coordination centre (NCCC)** to scan internet traffic coming into the country.
- **National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre** mandated to protect the critical information infrastructure in strategic areas such as air control, nuclear and space.
- National Cybersecurity Coordinator advises [[Prime Minister\|Prime Minister]] in strategic cybersecurity issues.
- **Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)**, is the nodal entity responding to various cybersecurity threats to non-critical infrastructure (under MEITY). 
	- CERT-In enhances the security through proactive action and effective collaboration. 
	- CERT-In is also operating **Cyber Swachhta Kendra**, a Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre. Government inaugurated the new body NIC-CERT to prevent and predict cyber-attacks on government utilities.
- Recently formed **Defence Cyber Agency**, a tri-service command of armed forces to coordinate and control joint cyber operations, and craft India's cyber doctrine, capable of offensive and defensive manoeuvres.
- A new **Cyber and Information Security (CIS)** Division has been created to tackle internet crimes such as cyber threats, child pornography and online stalking. 
- Cyber Warrior Police force has also been established.
- Ministry of Home Affairs - oversees overall coordination and  implementing **Cyber Crime Prevention against Women & Children #scheme**.
- Ministry of External Affairs coordinates India's [[Cyber diplomacy\|Cyber diplomacy]]
- The Cybercrime volunteer framework under the National Cybercrime Ecosystem Management Unit, which is a part of **Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)** #scheme.
- Internet ethics, cyber hygiene as a part of CDAC's National Cybersecurity strategy.
- **Cyber Surakshit Bharat Initiative** to strengthen cyber security ecosystem in India. It is first PPP of its kind and will leverage the expertise of the IT industry in cybersecurity. 
- In an operation that lasted over two months, the Delhi Police Cyber Cell busted a fake loan-cum extortion scam (Chinese nationals involved) of more than ₹500 crore and arrested 22 people from different parts of the country.
#### Flaws in the existing institutional framework
- Lack of effective coordination
- **Outdated systems and processes**
- **Accelerated digital adoption, over a short span of time** with lack of proper development of a back-end cyber security infrastructure, putting a large amount of data at risk.
- **Limited understanding about cyber security** the lack of understanding among the end user, continues to aid in successful cyber-attack instances.
- Overlapping responsibilities and lack of clear institutional boundaries.
- **Social engineering and phishing attacks**
- Poor accountability
- Hardly wired for cyber resilience
- India is yet to clearly articulate a cybersecurity doctrine, like [[India's nuclear doctrine\|India's nuclear doctrine]].
### Legislative and policy measures
- [[Information Technology Act, 2000\|Information Technology Act, 2000]] (amended in 2008) to provide a legal framework for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange, for data access for cybersecurity etc.
- National Cyber Security Policy 2013.
#### National Cyber security Policy, 2013
- In light of the growth of IT sector in the country, the National Cyber Security Policy of India 2013 was announced by Indian Government in 2013 yet its actual implementation is still missing. 
- As a result fields like e-governance and e-commerce are still risky and may require cyber insurance in the near future. To build secure and resilient cyber space.
##### Features cyber security policy, 2013
- Creating a secure cyber ecosystem, generating trust in IT transactions.
- The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) is to be the nodal agency to protect critical infrastructure, while another 24×7 agency, CERT-In, is to coordinate all emergency response and crisis management.
- Creating workforce of 5,00,000 professionals in the field.
- Fiscal benefits for businessman who accepts standard IT practices, etc.
- Indigenous technological solutions need to be developed to reduce reliance on foreign software. Testing of ICT products and certifying them.
- All organisations should designate a CISO and allot a security budget.
- Encourage use of **public key infrastructure (PIK)** for various government services. #pre2020 
- Engage info-sec professionals to assist e-governance initiatives, establish centres of excellence, cyber security concept labs for awareness and skill development etc.
##### Critical analysis of cyber security policy
- The policy mainly covers defensive and responsive measures and makes no mention of the need to develop offensive capability.
- The policy promises to develop a dynamic regulatory framework for technological developments without explaining what this framework would aim to do.
- The policy avoids addressing privacy vs security, censorship vs freedom of speech and use of indigenous security products versus importing vulnerable technology.
- The coordination of cyber security among various sectors of economy remains under the ambit of CERT-In. CERT-In is an civilian agency functions under the department of information technology.
- Most of the cyber crimes are expected to be dealt with by the local police under state government in combination with outside consultants. No efforts are taken to upgrade skills of local police.
- Most of the IT services have migrated to [[Cloud computing\|cloud computing]] now. NCSP is silent on dealing with threats emanating from new technologies. An earlier and constant revision of policy would make it more meaningfully equipped.
- ==CSP fails to address the overreach of state in cyberspace.== Further, with state outsourcing to private companies to build systems for mass surveillance, there is every chance of private data falling into wrong hands.
- Lack of awareness and the absence of culture of cyber security at individual as well as institutional level.
- Lack of trained and qualified manpower to implement the counter measures. We have only 5000 cyber security professionals, where as China has around 5 lakh personnel.
#### National Cyber Security Strategy
- National Cyber Security Strategy was conceptualised by the **Data Security Council of India (DSCI)** headed by *Lt General Rajesh Pant*. The report focused on 21 areas to ensure a safe, secure, trusted, resilient, and vibrant cyberspace for India.
- Centre is yet to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy.
##### Components of the National Cyber Security Strategy
- Large Scale Digitisation of Public Services: Focus on security in the early stages of design in all digitisation initiatives.
- Supply Chain Security: Monitoring and mapping of the supply chain of the Integrated Circuits (ICT) and electronics products.
- Critical Information Infrastructure Protection: Integrating Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) security.
- Digital Payments: Mapping and modelling of devices and platforms deployed, supply chain, transacting entities, payment flows, interfaces and data exchange.
- State-Level Cyber Security: Developing state-level cybersecurity policies, Allocation of dedicated funds.
- Security of Small And Medium Businesses: Developing security standards, frameworks, and architectures for the adoption of the [[Internet of Things (IoT)\|Internet of Things (IoT)]] and industrialisation.
##### Steps suggested in the report
- Budgetary Provisions: A minimum allocation of 0.25% of the annual budget, which can be raised up to 1% has been recommended to be set aside for cyber security.
	- Setting up a  **Fund of Funds for cybersecurity** and providing Central funding to States to build capabilities in the same field.
- Research, Innovation, Skill-Building And Technology Development: Providing investments in deep-tech cyber security innovation.
	- Creation of  a 'cyber security services’ with cadres chosen from the Indian Engineering Services.
- Cyber Insurance
- [[Cyber diplomacy\|Cyber diplomacy]]: Create ‘Cyber envoys’ for the key countries/regions.
- Cybercrime Investigation: Advanced forensic training for agencies to keep up in the age of AI/ML, Blockchain, IoT, Cloud, Automation.
### International Cooperation on Cyber Security
- **Budapest convention on Cybercrime (2001)**: Only binding international instrument. India is not a member of the same.
- Digital Geneva Convention - over 30 global companies have signed a declaration to protect users and customers from cyber breaches, and collaborate with likeminded intergovernmental and state frameworks.
- ==Paris call for trust and Security in Cyberspace== - High level declaration on developing common principles for securing cyberspace.
- **Christchurch call to Action** to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online.
- **Global centre for cyber security:** It was launched by the [[World Economic Forum\|World Economic Forum]] (WEF) to serve as laboratory and early-warning think tank for future cybersecurity scenarios.
- **Cyber diplomacy:** India has entered into cyber security collaborations with countries such as the USA, European Union and Malaysia.
- **Global Conference on Cyberspace 2017**
## Way forward
No readymade solutions to counter cyber attacks. We need defense-in-depth strategy.
- Cybersecurity doctrine
- Cybersecurity must essentially hinge on [[Personal data protection legislation#Personal data protection legislation\|data protection]].
- Improved coordination is needed between government and the private sector.
	- PPP model for cyber security
	- Creation of State and District Computer Emergency Response Teams.
	- Creation of Interstate coordination centre to deal with cybercrimes.
	- Ensuring coherence and coordination between these different actors should be the primary goal of National Cyber Security Strategy.
	- Clearer strategy and greater transparency are the need of the hour to enable a stable and secure cyber ecosystem.
- Education system should impart Cybersecurity hygiene in its curriculum to raise students as digital citizens. 
- Certain behavioural changes needed in cyberspace
	- Never click unsolicited links - **Beware of digital stranger danger**.
	- Only trust websites with HTTPS as URL, instead of HTTP as the S stands for Secure.
	- Use strong PASSWORDS and add another layer of security through enabling phone authentication.

An efficient and strategic cyber security infrastructure can help prevent these instances and save the government, businesses and individuals a lot of time, effort and money and information.

>Cyber security is an important part of our life today. Everything from national critical infrastructure to our basic human rights are dependent on secure cyber world. Hence  Governments are therefore urged to consider policies that support continued growth cyber security. #conclusion 

## Role of AI in cybersecurity
Cybersecurity confronts escalating threats, with AI both revolutionizing defenses against these evolving dangers and creating new challenges.

### AI as a defensive mechanism
- Anomaly detection: Identifies deviations from normal behavior, signaling potential intrusions.
- Malware analysis: Identifies and categorizes malicious software.
- Phishing detection filters: Detects deceptive emails attempting to acquire sensitive information.
- Incident analysis: Expedites incident analysis, identifies root causes, recommends tailored mitigation strategies, proactive threat hunting, and adaptive security configurations.
### Threat Landscape
- Sophisticated Attacks: AI-powered cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, evading traditional security measures.
- Automated Threats: Malicious actors automate attacks like phishing, malware deployment, and social engineering using AI, enhancing scale and efficiency.
- Zero-day Exploits: AI algorithms rapidly identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including emerging technologies, known as zero-day exploits.
### Challenges and Limitations
- Adversarial AI: Hackers can create sophisticated attacks bypassing AI-based defense systems, leading to a constant battle between AI-powered attacks and defenses.
- Ethical Concerns: AI raises ethical concerns regarding data privacy, bias in algorithms, and potential misuse by governments or organizations for surveillance.
### Potential use against India's Internal Security threats
- Critical Infrastructure Protection: AI-based cybersecurity strengthens the protection of critical infrastructure like power grids, transportation systems, and healthcare networks, crucial for internal security.
- Data Protection and Privacy: AI assists in securing sensitive data, ensuring privacy compliance, and preventing unauthorized access or breaches that can compromise internal security.
- Proactive Security Measures: AI enables proactive measures to anticipate internal threats, identifying insider threats and preventing data leaks or sabotage attempts.

AI plays a pivotal role in both perpetuating and countering cyber threats. Embracing AI in cybersecurity is essential for enhancing internal security, but it requires a balanced approach considering ethical implications and regulatory frameworks.

</div>




[[26-01-2021-Tuesday\|26-01-2021-Tuesday]]  11:02 AM

# Money laundering and its prevention
>As per Financial Action Task Force Money Laundering is the processing of profits or gains from criminal acts to disguise their illegal origin. #definition #introduction 
- When a criminal activity like smuggling, illegal arms sale or organised crimes generates substantial gains, the individual or groups must find a way out to control the funds without attracting attention to the underlying activity or person involved.
- As per [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\|UNODC]] ([[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\|United Nations office on Drugs and crime]]) estimates, the global flow of illicit funds is between 800 billion and 2 trillion US dollars annually. This figure has remained relatively stable over the past decade.
	- Money laundering is an issue that has gained increasing significance following the events of 9/11. It has recognised as a source of the funding of terrorist activities. 
	- The spread of international banks all over the world has facilitated the transmission and the disguising of the origin of funds.
- >**Hawala** - A trust based system of transferring money quickly in a parallel arrangement avoiding the traditional banking system and escaping the due tax. #definition 
- Bulk Cash Smuggling, Cash Intensive Businesses, Trade-based laundering, Shell companies and trusts, Round-tripping, Bank Capture, Gambling, Real Estate, Black Salaries, Fictional Loans, Hawala, False invoicing are some of the common methods of Money Laundering.
- **International Centre for Asset Recovery**, part of the Basel institute on Governance publishing Basel Anti-money laundering #index. It assesses the risk of money laundering and terrorist funding (ML/TF) around the world. 
	- In 2020 ranking, of the 141 countries listed, Afghanistan topped the list with an overall score of 8.16 marking highest risk. India was ranked 70 with an overall score of 5.15
	- ==South Asian region has the highest overall risk score and exceeds the global average across all categories.== Major deficiencies are the quality of AML/CFT frameworks and very high levels of corruption and bribery.
## Process of Money Laundering/How is Money Laundered?
The process of laundering money typically involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration.

![Pasted image 20220918190613.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220918190613.png)
- **Placement** surreptitiously injects the “dirty money” into the legitimate financial system.
	- This might be done by depositing smaller sums directly to banks, or purchasing monetary instruments like cheques that are then collected and deposited into accounts at another location.
- **Layering** conceals the source of the money through a series of transactions and bookkeeping tricks.
	- Might wire funds through a series of banks across the globe.
- In the final step, **integration**, the now-laundered money is withdrawn from the legitimate account to be used for whatever purposes the criminals have in mind for it.
	- Might choose to invest fund in real estate or luxury asset.
## Impact of Money Laundering
- Undermines the legitimate private sector - use of shell companies by money launders undermines the legitimate private sector.
- Undermines integrity of financial market - perceived involvement of financial institutions may lose confidence in consumers.
- Economic distortion and instability - misrepresent capital flows and destabilise the effective functioning of economy.
- Loss of Revenue - may reduce tax revenue, and government may levy higher tax to fulfil its obligations.
- Affect government’s Privatisation plan.
- Increased law and order issue may divert economic development.
- Affects trade and capital flows.
- Misallocation of resources.
- ==Launderers can offer bribes to public officials.== This may have devastating social consequences.
- It also provides fuel for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials and all types of criminals to operate and expand their criminal activities. 

>Laundering enables criminal activity to continue. Thus, money laundering can not only lead to economic offence but may also be a threat to international peace and security.
## Challenges to Tackle Money Laundering
- Growth of Technology: The enforcement agencies are not able to match up with the speed of growing technologies.
	- Anti-money laundering (AML) policies have been slow to adapt to the latest trends in money laundering, considering that most of the existing mechanisms focus on identifying illicit funds within traditional banking institutions and channels? Discuss  #MPQ 
		- Apart from being the preferred form of payment for buying ransomware tools and services, online exploitative material, drugs, and other illegal goods online, **Convertible Virtual Currencies (CVCs)** are increasingly used to layer transactions and obfuscate the origin of money derived from criminal activity. 
		- Criminals use a number of money-laundering techniques involving cryptocurrencies, including “mixers” and “tumblers” that break the connection between an address (or crypto “wallet”) sending cryptocurrency and the address receiving it.
- Non-fulfilment of the purpose of KYC Norms: Increasing competition in the market is forcing the Banks to lower their guards and thus facilitating the money launderers to make illicit use of it.
- Widespread act of smuggling: There are a number of black-market channels in India for the purpose of selling goods.
- Lack of comprehensive enforcement agencies: Separate wings of law enforcement agencies dealing with money laundering, cybercrimes, terrorist crimes, economic offences etc. lack convergence among themselves.
- Tax-haven countries: They have long been associated with money laundering because their financial secrecy laws allow the creation of anonymous accounts while prohibiting the disclosure of financial information.
- Huge volume of transaction makes identifying suspicious transaction difficult for financial institute and regulators.
	- Lack of trained manpower at lower helm
	- Lack of proper usage of technologies like AI and IoT
	- Lack of digitisation
	- Several banking systems not under purview of regulators
	- Complicated processes and regulations
	- Huge pending of cases at courts.
## Steps to Counter Money Laundering
### International
- **FATF**: FATF is an intergovernmental body established by the [[G7\|G7]] summit in Paris in 1989 and **responsible for setting global standards on anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism**. Blacklisting of countries by FATF.
- **OECD**: *Automatic Exchange of Financial Information* by many countries as part of the OECD initiative.
- **BEPS**: Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, under which the countries have agreed to take necessary measures.
- **UN convention against organised crime**: It is designed to combat the phenomenon of transnational organised crime.
- UN Convention against Corruption, 2005.
- **Vienna Convention** – criminalize laundering of money from drug trafficking.
- [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\|United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] – Proactively works towards identifying and stopping money laundering.
- **Asia Pacific Group against Money laundering**
- **Countering the financing of terrorism (CFT)**
- Anti-money laundering information network – An international Database
- Interpol's operation HAECHI-II to tackle cyber-financial crimes. 10 new modus operandi's identified.
	- Anti-Money Laundering Rapid Response Protocol (ARRP) developed by Interpol.
### Steps taken by India 
#### Legislative
- Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance - attachment of proceeds of crime relating to bribe, breach of trust and cheating by an order from court.
- The smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators (forfeiture of property) #Act Act 1976 - broad legislation which provides penalty for illegally acquired properties of smugglers and foreign exchange manipulators.
- Foreign Exchange Management #Act, 1999 (FEMA)
- India has criminalised money laundering under the PMLA, 2002.
	- There are mainly 3 objectives of PMLA:
		- To prevent and control money laundering.
		- To confiscate and seize the property obtained from the laundered money.
		- To deal with any other issue connected with money laundering in India.
- India has also criminalised money laundering under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances #Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), as amended in 2001.
- The Fugitive Economic Offenders #Act, 2018 (FEOA)
##### PMLA, (amendment) 2012
- Act has introduced the concept of corresponding law to link the provisions of Indian law with the laws of foreign countries.
- It also adds the concept of reporting entity which would include a banking company, financial institution, intermediary or a person carrying on a designated business or profession.
- The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 levied a fine up to Rs. 5 lakh. The amendment act has removed this upper limit.
- The act has provided for provisional attachment and confiscation of property of any person (for a period not exceeding 180 days). This power may be exercised by the authority if it has reason to believe that the offence of money laundering has taken place.
- The Act expands the definition of offence under money laundering to include activities like concealment, acquisition, possession and use of proceeds of crime.
##### PMLA, 2018 (amendment)
- Amendment in definition of “proceeds of crime”: It now allows the ED to proceed against assets of equivalent value located even outside the country.
- Bail provisions: It also makes the applicability of bail conditions uniform to all the offences under PMLA. The proposal comes after the Supreme Court recently struck down the previous stringent provisions.
- Corporate frauds: Corporate frauds is being included as scheduled offence under PMLA, so that Registrar of Companies can report such cases for action by [[Enforcement Directorate (ED)\|Enforcement Directorate (ED)]] for money laundering probe.
- Details sharing: The amendment also makes it mandatory for the ED to share relevant details with other agencies.
- Restoration of property: The amendment allows special court to restore confiscated assets to the rightful claimants even during the trial. Earlier, the assets could be restored only after completion of the trial.

##### Amendments to PMLA by Finance Act 2019
Major amendments through the Finance Act, 2019 have been brought in by way of inserting Explanations to respective Sections.
- The amendment **seeks to treat money laundering as a stand-alone crime.**
	- Till now Money Laundering was not an independent crime; rather depended on another crime, known as the **'predicate offence' or 'scheduled offence'**, the proceeds of which are made the subject matter of crime of money laundering.
- **Deletion of provisos in sub-sections (1) of Section 17 (Search and Seizure) and Section 18 (Search of Persons),** doing away with the pre-requisite of an FIR or charge sheet by other agencies that are authorized to probe the offenses listed in the PMLA schedule.
- **Insertion of an explanation in Section 44**: “The jurisdiction of the Special Court, while dealing with the offense under this Act, during investigation, inquiry or trial under this Act, shall not be dependent upon any orders passed in respect of the scheduled offense, and the trial of both sets of offenses by the same court shall not be construed as joint trial,” it says.
- **The scope of “proceeds of crime”, under Section 2, has been expanded:** to empower the agency to act against even those properties which “may directly or indirectly be derived or obtained as a result of any criminal activity relatable to the scheduled offense”.
- **Explanation added to Section 45 clarifies that all PMLA offenses will be cognizable and non-bailable:** Therefore, ED officers are empowered to arrest an accused without a warrant, subject to certain conditions.
- Section 72 will now give power to the Centre to set up an Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee for inter-departmental and inter-agency coordination for operational and policy level cooperation, for consultation on anti-money laundering and counter-terror funding initiatives.
- Another vital amendment makes concealment of proceeds of crime, possession, acquisition, use, projecting as untainted money, or claiming as untainted property as independent and complete offences under the Act.

**These amendments will further empower the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in tackling the cases of Money Laundering.**

###### What is 'proceeds of crime'?
- “Proceeds of crime” means any property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offense or the value of any such property.

###### What is a 'scheduled offense'?
- Scheduled offense means an offense specified under Part A or Part C of the Schedule of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.
	- In part A, offenses to the Schedule comprise of offenses under Indian Penal Code, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Explosive Substances Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, offenses under Arms Act, Wild Life (Protection) Act, Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, Prevention of Corruption Act, Explosives Act, Antiquities & Arts Treasures Act etc.
	- Part ‘C’ deals with trans-border crimes and is a vital step in tackling Money Laundering across International Boundaries.

###### Issues with amendments to PMLA
- Non-supply of the **Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR)** to the accused/arrested person.
	- The ECIR is an internal document of the ED and the fact that FIR in respect of scheduled offence has not been recorded, does not come in the way of ED authorities to commence inquiry/investigation.
- Power to make any person (including existing or future accused) state the truth on oath even though it may amount to self-incrimination.
- The burden of proving that proceeds of the crime are untainted property shall be on the accused.
- Blanket common and non-graded punishment for anyone associated with money laundering.
- Possible misuse of powers: There is a strong possibility that PMLA can be invoked against a political rival or a dissenter, because the “**process is itself the punishment**”.
- Contrast to General Criminal Law: PMLA is different from the General Criminal Law.
	- In General Criminal Law, every accused is innocent until proven guilty.
	- However, in PMLA, this burden has been shifted to the accused persons; they will have to prove their innocence.
- Accused-Bound to be a Witness: Section 63 of PMLA states that information must be given by the accused, false information or no information will constitute another offence.
	- Violates the right against self-incrimination: Compelling the accused to be a witness against themselves is violative of the right against self-incrimination.
- Inefficiency of ED and lower conviction: The conviction rate of Enforcement Directorate under this law is very low, despite thousands of cases registered, people arrested, and lives turned upside down.
	- According to the data quoted by the government in Parliament of India, there were zero convictions between 2005 and 2013-14. By 2014-15 to 2021-22, out of 888 cases under ED, only 23 cases were under conviction.

###### Issues cited by the court:
- The Act gives the government and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) virtually unbridled powers of summons, arrest, and raids.
- It makes bail nearly impossible while shifting the burden of proof of innocence on to the accused rather than the prosecution.
- Court made it clear that the State has a compelling interest in imposing stringent bail conditions for economic offences.
- The Court also said an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) cannot be equated with an FIR, and that supplying an ECIR in every case to the person concerned is not mandatory. 
	- It is enough if ED, at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest.
- SC ruled that no comparison can be drawn between PMLA and Criminal Procedure Code (1973). Including the mechanism regarding prevention, investigation or trial in connection with the scheduled offence.

#### Institutional
- [[Enforcement Directorate (ED)\|Enforcement Directorate (ED)]] for investigation and prosecution of cases under the PMLA.
- **Financial Intelligence Unit** – India (FIU-IND) for receiving, processing, analysing and disseminating information relating to suspect financial transaction.
- Anti-money laundering regulations of RBI/SEBI/IRDA.
- SEBI's measures to phase out p-notes
	-

# SEBI's measures to phase out p-notes

</div>


#### SEBI measures to phase out p-notes
- SEBI barred their issuance for speculative purposes from checking any misuse for channelizing black money. So, P-Notes can be issued only for the purpose of hedging (safeguarding) with respect to the equity shares held.
- SEBI tightened P-Note norms by deciding to levy a fee of USD 1,000 on each instrument.
- It had increased the know-your-customer (KYC) requirement.
- It also issued curbs on transferability, and prescribed more stringent reporting for P-Notes issuers and holders.
- It also decided to relax the entry norms for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) willing to invest directly in Indian markets rather than through P-Notes.
- It also mandated issuers to follow Indian anti-money laundering laws instead of norms prevalent in the jurisdiction of the end beneficial owner.


</div></div>

## Way Forward
- Adoption of AI, Machine learning related analytical technology to find suspicious transaction
- Better coordination between Regulators. 
- Giving more teeth to ED.
- Improve International Coordination.
- Speedy trials and convictions to avoid the process itself becoming the punishment.
- Government needs to look into major issues concerning the lower conviction rate and make sure the law is not misused.
- Internal Checks and Balances: There must be a consensus between the adjudicating authority and the officers of ED to abide by the constitutionality of provision under PMLA, making the investigation more lucid.
- Operational Vigilance: There must be a constant scrutiny over the operations of the ED and current disposition whether this clarification will improve the conviction.
- Promote digital transactions and increase digitisation of economy. 
- India must further its cross-border digital payment linkages to curb hawala transactions.
- Early introduction of The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)

>Governments will need to take a coordinated and holistic approach across all categories in order to lower their ML/TF risks and improve their healthy access to financial markets and investments. #conclusion 
# Menace of counterfeit money
>Counterfeit money is currency produced without the legal sanction of a state or government, usually in a deliberate attempt to imitate that currency and so as to deceive its recipient. #definition 
- Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery, and is illegal.
## Measures to stop fake currency
- It is necessary to stay ahead of counterfeiters. RBI needs to constantly upgrade both paper based (water mark) and print based (optical variable ink, see through effect) security features.
- Promote digital transactions and increase digitisation of economy.
- Frequently demonetise higher denomination notes like Rs.500 and Rs.2000.
- Increase cooperation among law enforcement agencies, border security agencies, police, etc.
- External dependence on security paper and ink could be reduced by increasing indigenous production. As most the paper is imported from EU, it can be asked to keep tight monitoring over currency rated printing in Pakistan.
- Early introduction of [[Cryptocurrency#The Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC\|The Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC]]

# LINKAGES OF ORGANIZED CRIME WITH TERRORISM
>Organized crime involves centralized criminal groups, operating at international, national, or local levels, that engage in illegal activities such as money laundering, drug and arms trafficking, human trafficking, counterfeiting, and cybercrimes. These activities are primarily motivated by financial gain. #definition 

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



>Terrorism is an act of disproportionate use of violence which create fear in the society, that ultimately helps to achieve a political, ideological or religious objective. #definition #introduction 

</div></div>

>Terrorism and organised crimes ([[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]], drug trade, weapons trade, human trafficking, fake currency) are **conjoint twins** that pose a great threat to the world through their syndicate and their deadly effects. #introduction 
- Till cold war OC and the Terrorism existed in separate spheres. Now they are metamorphing to interrelated single entity as terrorism require funds by illegal drugs and arms trade.
## Types of organised crimes
Organised crimes can be classified into two categories
- Traditional OC: includes illicit liquor trade, kidnapping, gambling, betting, robbery, sand mafia, mining mafia, contract killing, prostitution etc.
	- Traditional OC is based on power over local community, its mostly a family organisation.
- Non-traditional OC: includes trans-national crimes like [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|money laundering]], pumping of fake Indian currencies, Hawala transfer, Cybercrimes, human trafficking, arms smuggling, drug smuggling etc.

## Difference between terrorism & OC
|Terrorism| Organised Crime|
---------------|---------------
Political/ Ideological objectives| Economic Objectives
Aims to destabilise the government| Runs parallel with a favorable government
Primarily aimed at violence| Prefer nonviolence, often resort to violence

## Similarities between terrorism & OC
- Both use extreme violence and the threat of reprisals. The violent activities include use of kidnappings, assassinations, and extortion.
- Both operate secretly, though at times publicly in friendly territory.
- Both defy the state and the [[Rule of law\|rule of law]]. They present great security threat to the nations.
- Both are highly adaptable, innovative, and resilient.
- They both have provided social services, though this is much more frequently seen with terrorist groups.
## Factors that created nexus 
- End of [[Cold War\|Cold War]]: Terrorists had to find new ways for finance following the reduction in state financing for terrorist/insurgent movements.
- Communication revolution: Cyberspace act as a common platform for terror organisations and organised crimes to flourish.
- [[GS 1/SOCIETY/EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION ON INDIAN SOCIETY\|Globalisation]]: Removal of barriers and free movement of goods, services and people.
- Global war on terror: Crackdown on terror financing (mostly state sponsored) led to closer cooperation between terrorist organisations and crime syndicates.

## Organized Crime and Terrorism: The Black Hole syndrome
- A black hole is a **lawless enclave**, created as a result of the convergence of OC and terrorism, gaining economic and political control over a territory or an entire state.
- **Black Hole Syndrome** occurs when the primary motivation of the group engaged in civil war shift from political aims to criminal gains and when the state has been taken over by a crime terror group.

## Linkages
![Pasted image 20220919014029.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220919014029.png)
- Money through money laundering is used to fund the terror organisations. 
	- Hawala transactions of real estate in India are said to be used by terror groups in Pakistan to fund its activities.
- Drug trafficking started as an organised crime and has emerged as a threat to nation states because of its association with terrorist groups. Narcotics + Terrorism = Narco-Terrorism 
	- ==Taliban in Afghanistan is reportedly making some $100 million a year from drugs.== Terrorists give protection and support to drug traffickers with fire arms, and the drug traffickers, being acquainted with the routes, assist the terrorists in border crossings.
- Large amount of illegal small arms are manufactured in various illegal arms factories in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and sold on the black market for cheap prices. The illegal arms trafficking aids terrorists operating around the world.
- Terrorist organisations not only utilise human trafficking for financial support, they also use to obtain an entry point into countries. The slave trade is currently a multi billion industry built on demand for single product i.e. fellow human beings.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention#Menace of counterfeit money\|Currency counterfeiting]] is one of the organised white collar crimes which has assumed serious proportions in growing terrorism globally. Beyond issues of intellectual property theft and consumer safety, there is the notion that counterfeit sales directly fund terrorist organisations.
- Hybrid organisations: Displaying both the characteristics of a crime syndicate and terrorist organisation. e.g. *Republican Armed Forces of Columbia*.
## Factors which contributed to this
- Alleged political nexus between the politicians and various groups all over the world.
	- e.g., Wagner group (a private military company (PMC)) and alleged nexus with Putin's government in Russia.
- Corporates fund the terror groups indirectly as it help them to expand their business via arms trade, drug trade, oil production and post war facilities.
- Poor performance of global police forces like Interpol in curbing this linkage.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|Money laundering]], human trafficking goes unchallenged as regulations and laws are not very effective.
- Regional instability, religious propaganda further fuel these linkages. e.g. [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Role of external state and non state actors in creating challenges to internal security#Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan Security of India\|Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan]]
- Poor national law and order situations and lack of control over cyberspace leaves gaps in the security field.

## Impacts of nexus between terrorism and OC
### On government/state
- Fall or failure of state
- Governance failure
- Corrupt government
- Narco-state
- Loss of revenue
- Trade imbalance
- Reduced GDP
- Low investment and tourist inflow
- Shift in power to terror groups

### Society
- Erosion of trust in government
- More exposure to crime and violence
- High risk environment - pollution, riots
- Illegal human trafficking
- Drug addiction
- Health issues like HIV

### Global security
- Protracted war
- Fragile states
- Spike in illegal trade
- Less access to resources
- Migration
- Reduction in global GDP, investment etc.
- Economic disparity

## Way forward
- **There is a need for global cooperation in curbing the nexus.**
	- Stricter norms by UAE for sourcing gold - move aimed at preventing both [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Money laundering and its prevention\|Money laundering]] and terror financing.
	- Interpol led **Operation Pangea XIV** to crackdown fake medicines.
- **Adequate training and use of data analytics and artificial intelligence** monitoring tools to monitor socially harmful developments.
- **Increase efforts to integrate policy towards terrorism and organized crime:** enhance governments investigative and response capabilities; training focused on critical skills and exchange of skills between and among the nations.
	- Punjab government set-up a **anti-gangster task force (AGTF)**, a squad formed to eradicate organised crime in the state.  
		- Punjab government will provide requisite manpower, latest equipment and information technology, besides adequate funds "to break the unholy nexus which has already spread its wings in the drug trade and Kabaddi world".
- **Enhance Public Awareness** by sensitising communities and civil societies on the impact of terrorism and eliminate misconceptions through the mass media and other channels  


</div></div>
 can pose a significant threat to national security. Therefore, it is important to address these issues through effective management and prevention measures.

# Security challenges and their management in border areas
>India-China military standoff along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh has brought in Border management into light. #introduction 

## Why is Border Management important?
- Proper management of border is extremely important for our national security. 
- India has a land border of over 15,000 Km and share boundaries with 7 countries.
- It has a coastline of over 7500 Km.
- In Indian case, borders are quite complex and almost every type of extreme geography is present at different borders viz. deserts, fertile lands, swampy marshes or tropical evergreen jungles. 
- There is cross border smuggling, problem of drugs, cattle, humans, artefacts, fake Indian currency note (FICN), etc.
## General Challenges
- Porous Borders: Indo Bangladesh border. This porosity facilitates illegal activities like smuggling, trafficking etc. 
- Contested International Borders: e.g. Indo China Border.
	- ![Pasted image 20220802081051.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220802081051.png)
- Inefficiencies in border management Borders are guarded by forces which are under different ministries.
- Lack of critical Infrastructure: Road, critical technologies.
- Poor Intelligence and resource efficiency.
- Ethnic Conflict and separatist movement along Borders: Insurgent groups along Indo Myanmar border.
- G P Bhatnagar reports following issues
	- Security strategy designed for “Fire-fighting” rather than “Fire prevention” or pro-active approach.
	- Security strategy based on reaction and retaliation rather than holistic response.
## Diversity of borders
- Arid and desert border with Pakistan.
- Alpine mountains with rugged features and glaciers along borders of Pakistan and China.
- Plains and foothills with Nepal.
- Dense forests with Myanmar in the North-eastern region.
- Large coastline open to international waters.
### Problems
- Lack of proper demarcation of our land and maritime borders.
- Complex and different terrain on all borders makes it difficult to attain specialization in border management.
- Inadequate attention to security forces such as no mobile connectivity leading to isolation, inadequate medical facilities, disparity in wages and allowances in comparison with the army. Security forces have to face extreme conditions like extreme heat of Thar and extreme cold of Siachen glacier.
- Lack of coordination among multiple agencies associated with border security.
- Lack of infrastructure with border forces including shortage both in terms of manpower and physical infrastructure.
- Inadequate attention to the concerns of local people in border areas which is exploited by hostile elements to create a feeling of ill will against the security forces & Government.
- **Golden crescent** in the west and **Golden triangle** in the east are responsible for Drug trafficking.
- Eastern border and border with Nepal and Bangladesh are notorious for human trafficking and smuggling. It provides an easy escape route to Indian criminals (Naxals) to commit a crime here and cross the border.
- Open seas has allowed many foreign elements to come inside the Indian Territory. Mumbai attack was an eye opener in this regard. Indian youth are misguided and are taken across border to provide them militant training.
## Terrestrial border
>How far are India’s internal security challenges linked with border management particularly in view of the long porous borders with most countries of South Asia and Myanmar? #PYMQ 2013

>Analyse internal security threats and transborder crimes along Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan borders including Line of Control (LoC). Also discuss the role played by various security forces in this regard. #PYMQ 2020
### [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/India-Bangladesh\|India-Bangladesh]] border
- India shares around 4100 km of its land border with Bangladesh. The entire stretch consists of plain, riverine, hilly and with hardly any natural obstacles. 
- Instead of natural barriers, border meanders through villages, agricultural lands, etc. 
- Undemarcated stretches and adverse possessions had been causing constant friction between the border guarding forces of India and Bangladesh.

#### Challenges along India-Bangladesh border
- Illegal immigration: Poor development, religious persecution, environmental concerns etc., pushed Bangladeshis into India, while India’s huge economy and accommodative society pulled immigrants.
	- ==Communal violence in Assam has direct link with this immigration.==
	- Kuki-Chin refugees from Bangladesh tried to enter India through Mizoram.
- Cattle and other smuggling: Cattle from UP, Bihar is taken to borders for grazing and then smuggled to Bangladesh. ==This way government is losing revenue of around 10,000 crore annually.== Along with cattle, smuggling of arms, diesel, human and narcotics trafficking, counterfeit Indian currency are quite rampant along the India-Bangladesh border.
- Bases of Anti India elements: Presently, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) as well as several other insurgent outfits from the Northeast have bases in Bangladesh.

#### Measures taken for India-Bangladesh border management
- **Fencing**: Fencing and floodlighting are important constituents of maintaining vigilance along the borders. Government has undertaken the work of construction of fencing, floodlighting and roads along these borders.
- **Integrated check posts**: There are several designated entry and exit points on the international borders of the country through which cross border movement of persons, goods and traffic takes place. Conventional infrastructure for discharge of various sovereign functions at these points is neither adequate nor coordinated between various Government agencies.
- Land Border Agreement (LBA) with Bangladesh in 2015
- Establishment of Border protection grid with border states

### India-Pakistan border
- India-Pakistan border is spread across extreme climatic conditions given that the boundary runs from the hot Thar Desert in Rajasthan to the cold Himalayas in Jammu and Kashmir.
- The India-Pakistan boundary is categorised under three different heads. 
	- The first is the international boundary also known as the Radcliffe line. It is around 2000 km long and stretches from Gujarat to parts of Jammu district in Jammu and Kashmir.
	- The second is the line of control (LoC), or the ceasefire line, which came into existence after the 1948 and 1971 wars. This line runs from Jammu to Leh district.
	- And the third is the actual ground position line (AGPL) that divides current positions of Indian and Pakistani troops in the Siachen Glacier region.
#### Challenges along India-Pakistan border
- Border dispute at Sir Creek and Kashmir.
- River water sharing issue at Indus river.
- Infiltration and cross-border terrorism targeted to destabilise India. Cross border tunnels from Pakistan to J&K to push trained militants.
- Diverse terrain including desert, marshes, snow capped mountain and plains makes border guarding difficult.
- Time and cost overruns in infrastructure projects due to unforeseen circumstances and natural calamities.
- Other issues include drug smuggling, fake currency, arms trafficking, etc.
#### Measures taken for India-Pakistan border management
- Implemented Comprehensive Integrated Management system (CIBMS) to establish integrated all round security system.
- Deployment of special forces along Border
- Kartarpur corridor
- Integrated check post
### India-China Border
- India and China share a 3,500 km long boundary. 
- ==Unfortunately, the entire boundary is disputed.== 
- The line, which delineates the boundary between the two countries, is popularly called the McMahon line, after its author Sir Henry McMahon.
#### Challenges along India-China border
- Border dispute at Aksai Chin, Arunachal Pradesh, Doklam etc. with sporadic aggression.
- Large scale smuggling of Chinese electronic and other consumer goods.
- Inadequate infrastructure due to difficult terrain.
- Multiple forces along Indian border (for example, ITBP, Assam rifles, Special frontier force) as opposed to single PLA commander on Chinese side.
- Water sharing issue as China is building dams on its side reducing water flows on our side.
#### Recent initiatives by government along India-China border
- Creation of Chief of Defence staff (CDS).
- India has created some critical bridges to cut down time for troop movement such as **Dhola-Sadiya bridge**.
- India has joined hands with Japan to aggressively develop infrastructure projects in North east to contain China.
- ==Army infrastructure projects within 100 km of LAC have been exempted from forest clearance.== #ethicsexample - Environmental ethics vs greater good.
- To expedite border road construction, Ministry of Defence has decided to delegate administrative and financial powers to the Border Roads Organisation (BRO).
- Military talks to resolve LAC issues.
- Considering the length of India’s borders, the border forces will always remain inadequate.
	- They have to be supplemented with Home and Hearth units or village guards of the kind employed in Arunachal Pradesh. 
	- These Home and Hearth units, staffed with as many local ex-servicemen as possible, can be raised wherever border holding forces are thin on the ground.
### India-Myanmar boundary
>Cross-Border movement of insurgents is only one of the several security challenges facing the policing of the border in North-East India. Examine the various challenges currently emanating across the India-Myanmar border. Also, discuss the steps to counter the challenges. #PYMQ 2019
- After Independence, the boundary was demarcated in 1967 under an agreement signed by both countries. 
- There were many border agreements between India and Myanmar, in which borders were fluctuating and this has created confusion.
- The rugged terrain makes movement and the overall development of the area difficult.
- The internal dynamics of the region in terms of the clan loyalties of the tribal people, inter-tribal clashes, insurgency, and trans-border ethnic ties also adversely affect the security of the border areas.
- ==There is practically no physical barrier along the border.== Insurgents make use Free movement Regime (FMR) to cross-over to Myanmar and receive training and acquire arms.
- The location of the boundary at the edge of the golden triangle facilitates the unrestricted illegal flows of drugs into the Indian territory.
- It is reported that the local insurgent groups are actively involved in drugs and arms trafficking. Work for fence erection and road building is going on, but at times it is interrupted because of opposition.
#### Initiatives
- 13 Integrated Check Posts
- Joint operation to counter terrorism
- Joint military exercises
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



	- Idealism continued till the agreement to control drug trafficking. 

</div></div>


### India-Nepal border
- ==India and Nepal have shared an open border since 1950.== 
- The conception of such a border can be found in the **Treaty of Peace and Friendship** that the two countries signed that year. 
- Provisions in the treaty, wherein citizens of both countries are given equal rights in matters of residence, acquisition of property, employment and movement in each other’s territory, provide for an open border between the two countries.
- Open border has been a great facilitator of strong and unique bilateral relations. At the same time, it has given rise to many irritants and problems that raise serious concerns. Allegations of excesses such as intimidation and forcible grabbing of land by either side along the disputed border also surface from time to time.
- ==Many terrorist organisations and Naxalites have fully exploited open borders with Nepal.==
- Many hard core criminals pursued by Indian and Nepalese security forces escape across the open border. These anti-national elements indulge in illegal activities, such as smuggling of essential items and fake currency, gun running, and drugs and human trafficking.
- Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has been using Nepalese territory to carry out anti-India activities since the 1990s. ==**WikiLeaks** documents have revealed that the ISI has created a number of terrorist fronts in Nepal.==
#### Initiatives
- Increased operational capacity to SSB
- Establishment of Border District Coordination Committee to discuss issues of mutual concern
- Road construction along border

### India-Bhutan Border
- ==India and Bhutan share a 669 km long boundary.== 
- The boundary is demarcated except along the tri-junction with China. The process of demarcation of the India-Bhutan border started in 1961 and was completed in 2006. 
- Like with Nepal, India’s boundary with Bhutan is also an open boundary.
- The border was peaceful till Indian insurgent groups established camps in the southern districts of Bhutan. This problem has been effectively dealt with during the Bhutanese government’s #operation All Clear, which saw the destruction and uprooting of all insurgent camps in Bhutanese territory.
#### Initiatives
- Bilateral cooperation-secretary level bilateral mechanism.
- Demarcation of boundary
- Indian help during Chinese aggression in Chumbi valley.

### Way forward
- **CIBMS**: The Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) is an integration of a number of new gadgets and technologies to ensure electronic surveillance of India's international borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
- **Dispute resolution**: Government should resolve pending border disputes with the neighbouring countries, as they later become matters of national-security threat.
- **No diversion of security forces**: The border-guarding force should not be distracted from its principal task and deployed for other internal security duties. For example, ITBP, a force specifically trained for India-China border should not be used in the Naxalites infested areas.
- **Involvement of army**: It is felt that the responsibility for unsettled and disputed borders, such as the LoC in J&K and the LAC on the Indo-Tibetan border, should be that of the Indian Army while the BSF should be responsible for all settled borders.
- **Developing Infrastructure**: Intensifying the Border area development program (BADP) which funds states to invest in education, job creation and infrastructure will go a long way in managing borders. Vibrant Village Programme (VVP) to promote development and communication in border villages.
- Use of advanced technology: The advances in surveillance technology, particularly satellite and aerial imagery, can help to maintain a constant vigil along the LAC and make it possible to reduce physical deployment. e.g.  ==Smart wall technology could solve many border problems without the need for a physical barrier.== The wall would use sensors, radars, and surveillance tech to detect and track border break-ins.
- **Weapons**: BSF and ITBP should be armed with better sophisticated weapons and work conditions should be improved to give them confidence.
- **Border Haats**: Organising border Haats to build confidence and economically develop border areas.
- Improved Tactical and strategic mobility.
- Extension of projects Like BOLD-QIT.
- Close Coordination between centre and state.
- Professionalisation of border forces.

## Coastal
>India’s coasts have always been vulnerable to criminals and anti-national activities. Numerous cases of the smuggling of goods, gold, narcotics, explosives, arms and ammunition as well as the infiltration of terrorists into the country through these coasts have been reported over the years. #introduction 

### Factors that add to vulnerabilities of Indian coastline:
- Existence of these high value assets like scientific research centers, nuclear power stations, defence installations, energy infrastructure, shipyards, refineries located in coastal regions, has increased the vulnerability of India’s coasts to terrorist attacks.
- Maritime terrorism: hijacking, attacking, and sinking ships, taking hostages, sabotaging pipelines, and attacking cities and strategic installations like naval bases and petrochemical storages.
- Attacks on commercial centres: the 26/11 terror strike in Mumbai in 2008 targeted two iconic hotels and a Jewish centre.
- Smuggling and trafficking: The [[Indian Ocean\|Indian Ocean]] Region is regrettably home to the world’s most notorious areas of drug production, the Golden Crescent and the Golden Triangle. The trans-national networks established by the drug smugglers also serve as conduits for other destabilising activities like gunrunning and human trafficking. e.g. Recent capture of arms from Sri Lankan Vessel.
- Infiltration, Illegal Migration and the Refugee Influx: India's coastal boundaries have always been porous to infiltration by terrorists/militants and large-scale illegal migration. e.g. Sir creek areas of Gujarat have been highly vulnerable.
- Regional Instability: The Indian Ocean littoral has been witnessing large areas of political instability in the recent past. e.g. Yemen, Indonesia, Somalia, Iran-Iraq, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Indian [[India and Maritime security\|maritime security]] forces had to conduct dedicated operations to combat this menace, e.g. Indian intervention in the Maldives in 1988 to foil a coup d’état.
- Piracy: Statistics have shown an increase in piracy, off the coast of Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
	- >In 2012, the longitudinal marking for high-risk areas for piracy was moved from 65 degrees east to 78 degrees east in the Arabian Sea by the International Maritime Organisation. What impact does this have on India’s [[India and Maritime security\|maritime security]] concerns? #PYMQ 2014
- Lack of Cooperative mechanism among navy, Coast Guard and Coastal police
- Lack of effective surveillance mechanism
- Lack of necessary Infrastructure
- Disputed and not clearly demarcated boundaries. e.g. Sir Creek between India and Pakistan, Palk strait between India and Sri Lanka

### Government Initiatives in Coastal Security Infrastructure
- **National Committee for Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS)**, headed by Cabinet Secretary coordinates all matters related to Maritime and Coastal Security.
- **Indian Coast Guard**: The Indian Coast Guard has been additionally designated as authority responsible for coastal security in territorial waters including areas to be patrolled by Coastal Police. Training to Policemen deployed in coastal police stations is imparted by Indian Coast Guard.
- Kargil Review Committee (KRC) constituted to study the circumstances that had led to the war has recommended several coastal security measures like Specialised marine police, Strengthening of the ICG, Creating fishermen watch groups, Setting up Joint operation centres (JOCs), Creating an apex body for the management of maritime affairs, etc.
- **Marine Police Force**: Under the **Coastal Security Scheme (2005)** marine police force was created with the aim to strengthen infrastructure for patrolling and the surveillance of the coastal areas, particularly the shallow areas close to the coast. The Government of India has decided to set up Marine Police Training Institute (MPTI), one each on East Coast and West Coast to train marine police personnel.
- **Coastal Security Architecture**: Post the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the existing multi-layered arrangements have been further strengthened. A three-tier security grid was installed with the Indian Navy, the coast guard, and the marine police jointly patrolling India’s near-seas.
- **Electronic Surveillance**: **National Command Control Communication and Intelligence Network (NC3I)** has been launched to provide near gap-less surveillance of the entire coastline and prevent the intrusion of undetected vessels, the coastal surveillance network project.
- The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is implementing a comprehensive **Coastal Security Scheme (CSS)** to strengthen the security infrastructure in the Coastal States in India.
- Ministry of Shipping has been mandated to streamline process of compulsory registration and identification of all types of vessels.
- Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries has been mandated to issue biometric ID cards to all fishermen.
- The Coast Guard has been mandated to create a chain of radar sensors along the Indian coastline.
- Setting up Coastal Radar and AIS chain all along the coast and on island territories for 24X7 surveillance.
- Navy has set up 4 joint operation centers at Mumbai, Viskhapatanam, Kochi and Port Blair under the charge of existing naval C-in-Cs as the C-in Cs Coastal Defense.
- A **Sagar Prahari Bal** with a special force comprising of 1000 specialized personnel and 80 Fast Interceptor Crafts for force security protecting of naval bases has been raised.
### Regional Security Architecture involving India
- **SAGAR** – Security And Growth for All in the Region
- **Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)**: launched in 1997 for promoting intra-regional economic cooperation and development.
- **Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS)**: is a voluntary initiative formed in 2008 that seeks to increase maritime co-operation among navies of the littoral states of the Indian Ocean Region.
- **Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP)**: is a regional government-to-government agreement, brought into force in September 2006 to promote and enhance cooperation against piracy and armed robbery in Asia.
- **ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)**: objectives are to foster dialogue and consultation on political and security issues of common interest and make efforts towards confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region.
### Challenges
- Lack of coordination: The involvement of different agencies and ministries at centre, state and local level invariably leads to coordination problems although several efforts have been made to create greater synergies between them
- Lack of clarity among various stakeholders about their roles in ensuring coastal security.
- Acute shortage of workforce in police stations, (only 25% of the sanction)
- Poor Training: Lack of a dedicated training academy for the ICG.
- Discontent in fishermen communities interferes with the effective functioning of the coastal security architecture as fishermen are considered the ‘eyes and ears’ of the coastal security architecture and, therefore, an integral part of it.
- Difficult terrain, seasonal weather patterns, administrative lapses, etc. all contribute towards introducing gaps in surveillance and the monitoring mechanism.
- Delays in land acquisition and support infrastructure, such as barracks and staff quarters at several locations.
- Low infrastructure creation (only 31%): Jetties under the Coastal Security Scheme were yet to be constructed. Use of fisheries' piers by coastal police at extended distances from Coastal Police Stations (CSS).
- Below par state-level monitoring mechanisms.
### Way Forward
- Surveillance and inter-agency coordination: The central government must address the problems of coordination arising out of the interactions of multiple agencies (with overlapping jurisdictions) and delayed responses. Integration of Maritime Stakeholders continues to remain a key concern. There is a requirement of sharing information among all the agencies for coordinated action against the common threat.
- Stronger involvement of coastal police: Instead of setting up a coastal border security force with no legal powers, the authorities must move to strengthen and better integrate the coastal police into the littoral security architecture.
- A legislative framework: Comprehensive legislations to place systems and processes for the protection of India’s maritime infrastructure, covering both the shipping and port sectors.
- Statutory duties of government departments, Port trusts, state maritime boards, non-major ports and private terminal operators and other stakeholders need to be clearly outlined, as also minimum standards of port security requiring statutory compliance.
- Strengthening of the Coast Guard: The CG must be strengthened to play a leadership role in coastal security. Ambiguities from the Coast Guard Act need to be removed to ensure all security agencies are clear about the roles and responsibilities they are expected to perform.
- **National commercial [[India and Maritime security\|maritime security]] policy document**: The government must promulgate a National Commercial Maritime Security Policy Document, to articulate its strategic vision for [[India and Maritime security\|maritime security]]. It must also promulgate a national strategy for Commercial [[India and Maritime security\|Maritime Security]] for efficient, coordinated, and effective action for protection of the port and shipping infrastructure.
- **Reinforce Coastal Regulation Zone regulations**: There is an apprehension among environmentalists that CRZ laws are being diluted in favour of tourism, shrimp farming and industry lobby groups, without taking into consideration the views of experts or the public.
- Coastal security exercises like **Sagar Kavach** and **sea vigil** need to be conducted regularly, in order to generate awareness about threats emanating from the sea as well as to develop synergies among the concerned agencies.
- **Fishermen and coastal communities** should be included in the comprehensive coastal security plan as ‘**eyes and ears’ of security agencies**.
- Upgradation of coastal security infrastructure with latest equipments and gadgets.
- Use of Nano-satellite for higher level security could be considered. Nano-satellites Tracking of ships (NTS) successfully in tracking of ships/ fishing crafts using space based AIS technology. 

Government has initiated several measures to strengthen Coastal Security, which include improving surveillance mechanism and enhanced patrolling by following an integrated approach. 

>Coastal surveillance is not just technology to defend valuable assets. Coastal security is prevention of access to hinterland to all anti nationals and nefarious elements. #conclusion 

## Air borders
>**Airspace** is the portion of the atmosphere controlled by a country above its territory, including its territorial waters. #definition 
- Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within which air traffic control (ATC) service is provided in accordance with the airspace classification.
- International air space above the high seas beyond 200 nm
- An **Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)** is airspace over land or water in which the identification, location, and control of civil aircraft is performed in the interest of national security. They may extend beyond a country's territory to give the country more time to respond to possibly hostile aircrafts.
- Outer space is governed by **Outer Space Treaty,** (1967), international treaty binding the parties to use outer space only for peaceful purposes.

### Why need for regulation
- Possible misuse by countries for waging wars - 4th dimension of warfare in space.
- Can be used for testing harmful chemicals, hazardous nuclear tests etc. affecting the other nations.
- Countries involved in tussle over the air space and ADIZ. e.g. China and Japan over Senkaku Island.
- Surveillance through spy planes.
- Jurisdiction in case of crimes and terrorist activities like **Flight hijack**
- Ensure safety and security of passengers in International Air space

### Way forward
- UNCLOS model law under International Civil Aviation Organisation under UN.

## #PYMQ on border management
- The use of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) by our adversaries across the borders to ferry arms/ammunitions, drugs, etc., is a serious threat to the internal security. Comment on the measures being taken to tackle this threat. #2023/150/10

# various security forces and agencies, each with their own mandates and responsibilities

</div>



[[03-12-2021-Friday\|03-12-2021-Friday]]  9:23 AM

# Various security forces, agencies and their mandate
The security forces in India are mainly concerned with securing India’s national interest and protection of the territorial integrity and sovereignty. It may be classified as
- Politico-administrative bodies
- Intelligence Agencies
- Enforcement agencies

## Politico-administrative bodies
These are the bodies/committees that are indulged in decision making with respect to the national security and related aspects.

### Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS)
- It is the apex body that deals with policy making concerned with the defence of India.
- The members include Prime minister, Defence Minister, Home Minister, Finance Minister and Minister of External Affairs.

### National Security Council (NSC)
- It is headed by NSA and reports to PMO.
- It has a 3 tier structure
	- Strategic policy group
		- Plans for long term security
		- Cabinet Secretary + 3 chiefs of staff + IB chief + RAW Chief + Secretaries of departments (as required).
	- National security advisory board
	- Joint intelligence committee
		- Analyse the intelligence data

### National Security Advisor (NSA) 
- Advisor to PM
- Advices on all national and international security related events.
	- Also assists PM during International Visits.
	- IB & RAW reports to NSA

### Ministry of Home Affairs (MoH)
- The dedicated ministry to look after the matters of internal security.
- It is headed by Minister of home affairs with cabinet rank.
- The ministry in turn has various specialised divisions like
	- Cyber & Information Security division
	- Border Management division
	- LWE division
	- Internal Security division
	- Disaster management division

### Ministry of Defence
- Headed by Minister of defence.
- The supreme commander of all defence forces in India is President of India. (Art. 53)
- Main functions include
	- Defence
		- Defence production
		- Defence forces
		- Defence research
	- Policy directions on matters of defence
	- Armed force tribunals

## Intelligence Agencies
- These are the bodies/committees that are indulged in intelligence gathering on various fields.
- The major intelligence agencies are:
#### Intelligence Bureau - IB
- It is considered to be the oldest intelligence agency in the world. The formation was during British era (1887) while it was renamed as Central Intelligence Bureau post independence.
- They directly reports to NSA.
- There are no enquiry or audits associated with IB. They are classified agency.
- Though initially IB gathered intelligence tips from within and outside country, 1962 Indo-China war is considered to be a Intelligence failure of the institution.
	- This resulted in bifurcation of the duties thus limiting majorly to domestic intelligence gathering.
	- External intelligence gathering is bestowed upon RAW

#### Research and Analysis Wing – RAW
- Created post 1962 Indo-China war.
- Reports to NSA
- External intelligence gathering arm of India.
- Highly classified activities.
#### Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND)
- This was created as an obligation towards the UN Convention on transnational organised crimes 2003.
- It works under Ministry of Finance.
- The main aim is realisation of Prevention of money laundering act (PMLA 2002)
- They receive inputs from financial institutions and help enforcement agencies.
- RBI, SEBI, IRDA etc. shares information.
- Takes care of international agreement on information sharing on revenue/finance.
#### Directorate of Revenue Information

	- Collection of intelligence about smuggling of contraband goods, narcotics, under-invoicing etc. through sources of India and abroad, including secret sources.
	- Guiding important investigation/prosecution cases. Keeping liaison with foreign countries, Indian Missions and Enforcement agencies abroad on anti-smuggling matters.
	- To refer cases registered under the Customs Act to the Income Tax Department for action under the Income Tax Act.
	- To keep statistics of seizures and prices/rates etc. for watching trends of smuggling and supply required material to the ministry of Finance and other Ministries.
#### NATGRID
##### Importance of NATGRID
- National Intelligence Grid or NATGRID is an intelligence grid **connecting the databases of 21 core security agencies to collect comprehensive patterns of intelligence**. These databases include railway and air travel, income tax, bank account details, credit card transactions, visa and emigration records etc.
- Despite prone to such terror attacks, we don’t have a well formulated database of these terror networks.
- The idea is to collate and analyse vital data to get the complete view of a situation. Details that take one to three months can be had within minutes.
- NATGRID will tackle the problem of coordination between various law enforcement agencies in various ministries.
- Due to federal nature of government, the coordination at center and states level is also lacking and in the case of any emergency, the response mechanism is not effective. Here too NATGRID will be useful.
##### Criticism of NATGRID
- NATGRID is facing opposition on charges of possible violations of privacy and leakage of confidential personal information.
- NATGRID will have access to all kinds of data under one roof and can also prove to be counter-productive if misused.
- Crucial intelligence information, if available to many agencies, can be leaked and used against the nation.
- NATGRID's organisational structure is problematic - 2/3rd of the staffs from private sector and only 1/3rd staffs from government sector.
- No state agency or police force has access to its database thus reducing chances of immediate, effective action.
- NATGRID also faces issues like consolidating data from a huge population, lack of compatibility with data sets in regional languages, risk of spies ratting out vital information to outside sources and security from external attacks.
## Enforcement Agencies
- These are the bodies that are indulged in enforcement of the security. 
- The majority of federal law enforcement agencies are controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
- The Various security enforcement forces in India include 
	- Indian Armed Forces 
	- Indian Coast Guard 
	- Armed Police Forces (CAPF and paramilitary forces) 
	- Investigating agencies - CBI, NIA, ED
	- State Police Forces
		- Law and order is a state subject of the state, therefore the bulk of the policing lies with the respective states and territories of India.
		- Larger cities also operate metropolitan police forces (MPF) under respective state governments.

### Indian Armed Forces
- Indian Armed Forces consists of three major forces viz: Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Airforce. 
- The Indian armed forces are commanded by Chief of staff for each of the forces. 
- But the supreme commander for the defence forces in India is the Honorable President of India. 
- Executive control is exercised sequentially through the Union Cabinet, the Defence Minister, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the Chiefs of Army, Naval and Air Staff of their respective Services. 
	- Chief of Defence Staff & Department of Military Affairs (DMA): The post of CDS was created to increase efficiency & coordination among the Armed Forces and reduce duplication, while DMA was established to ensure improved civil-military integration.
- The Ministry of Defence handles matters related to personnel, financial and resource management.
#### Indian Army
- Indian army is the territorial arm of the Indian armed forces. 
- The mandate of the Army is to safeguard National Interests from External Aggression and Internal Subversion. 
- It also includes Peace Keeping Operations or Military Assistance to friendly foreign countries. 
- Army render Humanitarian Assistance, Disaster Relief and Aid to Civil Authorities.

##### Excessive deployment of the Army is bad
In many troubled states, the Army has been deployed in large numbers to ensure law and order and conditions. But once committed, these forces have usually had to remain deployed for several decades.

- First, an over dependence on the Army reflects lack of trust and faith in the capability of the state and central armed police and paramilitary forces.
- Second, with the passage of time, the locals start treating the Army as just another police force.
- Third, such deployments and prolonged duties have an adverse impact on the Army’s discipline, morale and operational effectiveness.
- Fourth, during a war, the Army requires public support. It cannot afford to alienate the local population as is currently happening in Manipur, and to some extent, in J&K and Assam.

Reduction in Army deployment will be possible only if the paramilitary, central and state police forces can be revamped. There is a need to modernise these forces, improve their leadership, training and man management capabilities.

#### Indian Navy
- Indian Navy is the marine arm of the Indian Armed forces. 
- The mandate of the Indian Navy is to provide security to India's territorial integrity, citizens and off-shore assets from sea-borne threat taking into consideration India's national interests and [[India and Maritime security\|maritime security]]. 
- It also includes safeguarding India's mercantile marine and marine and maritime trade.
- The office of Chief of Naval Staff is at the Integrated Headquarters MoD (Navy) at New Delhi. 
- Indian Navy has 3 other commands viz – Western (stationed at Mumbai), Eastern (Stationed at Vishakhapatnam) and Southern (stationed at Kochi). Along with these, there is another command at Port Blair – Andaman & Nicobar Command.
#### Indian Airforce
- Indian airforce is the air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. 
- The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October 1932.  
- Air force is mandated to secure the Indian airspace during the time of war or external aggression. 
- They are also entitled to provide to services for Disaster management or humanitarian assistance to civil authorities.
- Indian Air Force is headquartered in New Delhi. 
- For effective command and control, the IAF has seven command, under which there are different stations and units located at various places throughout the country – Western, Eastern, Central, South-Western and Southern along with a Training command and a maintenance command.
- Indian Navy is able to collaborate with naval forces of other nations.
### Indian Coast Guard
- The mandate of ICG includes – to protect our ocean and offshore wealth including oil, fish and minerals; to assist mariners in distress and safeguard life and property at Sea; to enforce maritime laws with respect to sea, poaching smuggling and narcotics; to preserve marine environment and ecology and protect rare species; to collect scientific data and back up the navy during war. 
- The motto is –“VAYAM RAKSHAMAH – We protect”.
- ICG has two major commands viz – Western Sea board and Eastern sea board with its headquarters at New Delhi headed by Director General CG.
- The Indian Coast Guard is limited to Indian coastal waters. The Indian Navy, on the other hand, operates in the Persian Gulf, the Somali Peninsula and the Straits of Malacca, primarily. It also gets deployed to the South and East China Seas and the Mediterranean Sea. The Navy trains and maintains personnel, equipment for combat in the event of wars and to maintain freedom in international waters.
### Armed Police Force
- The CAPF works under the Police II – Division under Ministry of Home Affairs. 
- This Division deals with the policy, personnel, operational (including deployment) and financial matters relating to all the Central Armed Police Forces. 
- CAPF includes various other divisions viz:
	1. Border Security Force
	2. Central Industrial Security Force
	3. Central Reserve Police Force
	4. Indo-Tibetan Border Police
	5. National Security Guards
	6. Sashastra Seema Bal
- Paramilitary forces includes Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Forces.
#### Assam Rifles
- Border guarding force for **Indo- Myanmar border**
- They are also mandated to take up Counter insurgency operations in the North East especially, under the operational control of Indian Army.
- The Force is commanded by an officer of the rank of Lieutenant General of the Army.
- The highest HQ of the force known as the HQ Directorate General of Assam Rifles is located at Shillong. 
- Assam Rifles is a region specific force with its operational role in the North East.
- There are 46 battalions of Assam Rifles at present.
- The humane, just and ever helpful approach of the men of Assam Rifles has truly managed to win hearts and minds earning the Assam Rifles the sobriquet of ‘Friends of the North East'

#### Border Security Force
- The Border Security Force came into existence on 01 Dec 1965,
- BSF is well capable of guarding 6386.36 Km (2289.66 Km - **Indo Pak** Borders, 4096.7 Km **Indo-Bangladesh** Borders) of the International Borders and 237.2 Km of the Line of Control (LC).
- In addition, BSF is capable & efficient enough to take on other challenges effectively like Counter-Insurgency/Anti-Militancy/Anti-Naxal Operations, Election Duties, Law& Order Duties, UN Peace Keeping Missions, Disaster Management and National/ International level functions and any other tasks assigned by the Government of India.
- BSF works under the rules – BSF Act 1968, BSF Rules, 1969 and BSF (Amendment) Rules, 2017

##### Wider powers to BSF
- Recently, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a notification to widen the jurisdiction of Border Security Force (BSF) for seizure, search and arrest from 15 km up to 50 km from the international border in Assam, West Bengal and Punjab.
###### Why this move is suitable?
- To contain multiple crimes happening near border areas. The violations for which the BSF carries out search and seizure include smuggling of narcotics, other prohibited items, illegal entry of foreigners and offences punishable under any other Central Act among others.
- To bring uniformity to the security architecture in and around borders.
- Reduces the burden on state police forces who are less equipped to deal with international crimes.
###### Issues raised by the order
- Public Order vs Security of State: Public order, which is primarily the responsibility of State Government could be overlapped by the Union government if the issue becomes grave and threatens the defence of the state (Entry in Union list).
- Weakening Spirit of Federalism: Without obtaining the concurrence of the state government, the notification amounts to encroachment on the powers of the states. The Punjab Government has asserted that this notification is Centre’s encroachment under the guise of security or development.
- Affects the functioning of BSF: Policing in the hinterland is not the role of a border guarding force, rather it would weaken the capacity of the Border Security Force in discharging its primary duty of guarding the international border.
- Lack of clarity: The notification is not clear regarding how the BSF’s extended jurisdiction helps counter various security threats. The recent drug seizures in Gujarat’s Adani port were successfully conducted by the customs department and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence - not by the BSF, despite their jurisdiction depth of 80 kilometres in the state.
- No need for uniformity: There is no uniformity between coastal smuggling in Gujarat, cross-border infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir, smuggling and drone drops in Punjab. Hence a uniform approach is not what is required for countering these diverse crimes.
- Risk of civilian resentment: The order raises the risk of civilian resentment, even clashes, given that the BSF is not trained to operate in residential and/or market areas.
- Potential Human rights issues: Possibility of human rights excesses by military personnel on civilians.
- Undermines the authority of state police forces: It will undermine the morale of state police forces even further.
###### Way Forward
- Improving Coordination between security agencies: The underlying issue when it comes to tackling both smuggling and infiltration threats is coordination between central and state security agencies.
- Police reforms: The state police forces have weakened, therefore, the solution lies in putting police reforms on an emergency footing, not in extending the BSF’s jurisdiction.
- Moreover, to strengthen police capabilities it is vital that other security forces cooperate with local police forces, not bypass them.
- Improving intelligence networks: When it comes to cross-border infiltration, intelligence is the key and coordination between Intelligence Bureau (IB) and RAW is key.
- Provide training to forces to become people friendly to garner confidence of the civil society.

#### Indo-Tibetan Border Police
- Indo-Tibetan Border Police was raised on October 24, 1962 for reorganizing the frontier intelligence and security set up along the Indo-Tibetan border.
- ITBP was initially raised under the CRPF Act. However, in 1992, parliament enacted the ITBPF Act and the rules there under were framed in 1994
- ITBP presently has 56 service Battalions, 4 Specialist Battalions, 17 Training Centres and 07 logistics establishments with a total strength of approx. 90,000 personnel.
- The entire stretch of India-China Border comprising 3488 Kms was assigned to the ITBP for Border Guarding duty in 2004 replacing Assam Rifles in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.
- The various mandates includes:
	- Vigil on the northern borders, detection and prevention of border violations, and promotion of the sense of security among the local populace.
	- Check illegal immigration, trans-border smuggling and crimes.
	- Security to sensitive installations, banks and protected persons.
	- Restore and preserve order in any area in the event of disturbance.

#### Sashastra Seema Bal
- SSB (earlier known as Special Service Bureau) was declared as a Border Guarding Force in 15th January, 2001 under the Ministry of Home Affairs and renamed as "Sashastra Seema Bal" on 15th December, 2003.
- On 19 June, 2001 SSB was given the mandate to guard the Indo-Nepal Border (1751 Kms.) and was declared the Lead Intelligence Agency for that area. 
- The added responsibility of guarding Indo-Bhutan Border was given to SSB on 12th March, 2004 along with being declared the Lead Intelligence Agency for that border. 
- SSB is now spread along the International border across Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.
- Its mandate includes – prevent trans-border crimes, smuggling and any other illegal activities; prevent unauthorised entry into or exit from territory of India; carry out civic action programme in the area of responsibility; perform any other duty assigned by the Central Govt (including being deployed for law & order, counter insurgency ops and election duty).
- SSB got the consent of the President of India, on 20th December, 2007 for the SSB Act and Rule.
- Headquartered at New Delhi, SSB has six operational frontiers with around 67 battalions manning the Indo-Nepal Border and Indo-Bhutan Border – Ranikhet, Lucknow, Patna, Siliguri, Tezpur and Guwahati.

#### Central Industrial Security Force
- CISF is an Armed Force of the Union raised under an Act of Parliament namely Central Industrial Security Force Act, 1968.
- Force was raised with a strength of 3129 in the year 1969 which has increased to a strength of 1,43,431 as on January 2019.

CISF Fire Wing is providing fire safety coverage to 102 different installations all over the country with a strength of 7549 fire professionals.
- CISF is cost re-imbursement force.

#### Central Reserve Police Force
- The Central Reserve Police Force came into existence as Crown Representative’s Police on 27th July 1939. It became the Central Reserve Police Force on enactment of the CRPF Act on 28th December 1949.
- The mandate of the Central Reserve Police Force shall be to enable the government to maintain Rule of Law, Public Order and Internal Security effectively and efficiently, to preserve national integrity and promote social harmony and development by upholding supremacy of the constitution.
- ==It is all India in character, both in deployment and in its composition.== Due to its unique capability to quickly adapt to various situational requirements, and also, to work in perfect harmony with the State Police, CRPF has, over the years, acquired the distinction of being perhaps the most acceptable Force, by the people and the State administrations
- The Force has grown into a big organization with 243 Battalions, (including 210 executive Bns, 6 Mahila Bns, 15 RAF Bns, 10 CoBRA Bns, 5 Signal Bns and 1 Special Duty Group, 1 Parliament Duty Group), 43Group Centres, 20 Training Institutions.
- **CoBRA - Commando Battalion for Resolute Action** - is the specialised unit proficient in guerrilla tactics and jungle warfare.
#### National Security Guards
- The motto is “ Sarvatra Sarvottam Suraksha ”
- It is the federal contingency world class zero error force to deal with anti-terrorist activities in all its manifestation.
- They are specially equipped and trained to deal with specific situations and is therefore, to be used only in exceptional circumstances to thwart serious acts of terrorism.
- NSG formally came into being with the assent of President on Sept 22, 1986
- NSG is modelled on the pattern of SAS of UK and GSG-9 of Germany.
- They have two complementary elements – Special Action Group and Special Rangers Group comprising of the personnel drawn from the CAPF / State Police forces.

#### Special Frontier Forces
- It is a covert paramilitary special force which operates under India’s external intelligence agency RAW and reports directly to the Cabinet Secretariat.
- Following the 1962 Sino-Indian war, India setup the SFF or Establishment 22, composed of ethnic Tibetans and modelled on the U.S. Army’s Green Berets to operate behind Chinese lines in the event of another war with China.
- Their role includes special reconnaissance, direct action, hostage rescue, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare and foreign internal defence covert operations.
- Apart from Chinese duty, they also played a crucial role in Bangladesh Liberation War 1971 and also in various internal operations like Operation Blue Star, Cactus, Pawn etc.
- They are headquartered at Chakrata, Uttarakhand.

#### Contribution of CAPF & paramilitary forces
- Disaster: During the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, Indo-Tibetan Border Police was the first to respond to the catastrophe.
- Organised crime: The paramilitary forces like the BSF, Sashastra Seema Bal, ITBP deployed at borders check smuggling of drugs, fake currencies and human trafficking along with border security.
- Law and order: The CRPF personnel provides their services when law and order situation goes beyond the control during riots or large scale violence.
- Naxalism: The paramilitary forces are also deployed in fighting insurgencies and violent activities like Naxalism.
#### Problems
- There is shortage of man power which increases the workload on existing personnel. ==It is found that CISF jawans have to do continuous duty for 15-18 hours.==
- There is an absence of a dedicated grievance redressal system. 
	- Ex: Recent BSF Jawan video.	A paramilitary soldier was against the **sahayak/buddy system** where soldiers were forced to do personal chores for senior officers of the force.
- Poor working conditions like no housing facilities, poor food and low allowances adds to problems.
- Top most positions are occupied by IPS officers which leads to a low morale that translates into low efficiency.
- Promotion system lacks a proper path and set indicators to identify the deserving candidate.
- They are devoid of justice. Armed forces tribunal does not cover them. ==Even Article 33 deters them to approach civilian judiciary.==
- No stability in terms of duration of posting and no peace posting. There are many accompanying services like, VIP security, law and order and election duty.
- Till lately gallantry awards such as Paramvir chakra, Shaurya Chakra and Kirti Chakra were reserved only for the armed forces.
- Government does not accord them the status of a martyr.

#### Issues with Border Guarding forces
- Jawans are overworked and hence fatigued during the patrolling duty.
- Medical facilities for personnel posted on the border are severely inadequate. The personnel had to be transferred to frontier head quarters for even basic treatment.
- Disparity in wages and allowances in comparison with the army.
- There is an absence of a dedicated grievance redressal system. Poor working conditions like no housing facilities, poor food and low allowances adds to problems.
- There is no mobile connectivity in Border Outposts (BOPs) and the only available means of communication with their families is through satellite phones.
- Deficiency of some surveillance equipment, like Hand-held Thermal Imagers, which are essential for surveillance during night.

#### Steps taken by Government
- Increased hardship allowances will be given to CAPF jawans in Naxal areas. Posting of choice after serving in the naxal affected areas.
- ==To curb depression among jawans, yoga, meditation and recreation facilities are provided.== - A rational and fair leave policy and well regulated duty hours to provide optimum rest.
- Increased interaction between jawans and officers were part of the 14 measures undertaken by government to boost morale.
- Retention of housing in last posting to ensure education of children of the forces remain undisturbed.
- 7th Pay Commission has recommended a review of posts earmarked for IPS officers and recommended to open higher positions for CAPF officers as well.
#### Recommendations
- The proposals of BGFs to raise additional number of battalions should be considered on a priority basis.
- Composite BOPs should be developed with telephone, medical facilities etc.
- Hard area allowance should be exclusively decided on the basis of climatic and geographical conditions of the area of deployment and should be uniform for personnel of all the forces, be it CAPFs or Army.
- To curb depression among jawans, yoga, meditation and recreation facilities are provided.

### Investigating agencies
#### National investigative agency (NIA)
- National Investigation Agency (NIA) is a central agency established by the Government to combat terror in the country. 
- The agency is empowered to deal with terror related crimes across states without special permission from the states. NIA has concurrent jurisdiction.
- Till 2019 the NIA has seen a 91% conviction rate in terror cases.
##### Shortcomings in NIA
- Overstretched intelligence network with limited staff and meagre budget. It is currently operating with three-fourth of its sanctioned staff.
- NIA at most of the times takes help in intelligence gathering from local police, who are typically poorly trained and ill equipped.
- There is lack of cooperation from state governments.
- It is potentially open to political interference and it arguably should have jurisdiction over additional offences that have a trans-national character.
- India has multiple intelligence and investigation agencies along with the police. The IB is the domestic unit and the RAW is an external spy agency. The military and paramilitary organizations run their own intelligence wings.
- NIA is not empowered to investigate a number of interstate and trans-national crimes that require a national response.
##### NIA, 2009
- NIA can investigate offences under Acts such as the **Atomic Energy Act, 1962** and the **Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967**. For the offences under its purview, NIA officers have the same power as other police officers and these extend across the country.
- The existing Act allows the Centre to constitute special courts for NIA’s trials.
##### NIA amendment act, 2019
- Type of offences that the NIA can investigate and prosecute is now expanded. As per the Bill, the NIA will now have the power to investigate offences like human trafficking, cyber terrorism, counterfeit currency etc.
- The Bill gives NIA officers the power to investigate offences committed outside India, subject to international treaties and domestic laws of other countries. The Special Court in New Delhi will have jurisdiction over these cases.
- The Bill states that the central government may designate Sessions Courts as Special Courts for the trial of scheduled offences.
##### Criticism
- Encroachment of Federal power.
- Sessions courts are already burdened with many cases.

### AFSPA
- **Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act**, enacted in the year 1958, grants extraordinary powers and immunity to the armed forces to bring back order in the disturbed areas. 
	- The genesis can be traced to Armed Forces (Special Power) Ordinance, 1942 enacted by the British to subjugate rebels during [[GS 1/HISTORY/MODERN/QUIT INDIA MOVEMENT\|QUIT INDIA MOVEMENT]].
- AFSPA empowers the Governor of the State to issue an official notification declaring the state or a region within as a “**disturbed area**", after which the Centre can decide whether to send in armed forces.
- Some of these extra-ordinary powers include Fire upon anyone after giving warning, Arrest anyone without warrant, Stop and search any vehicle or vessel and **Armed forces personnel have legal immunity for their actions**.
#### Arguments for AFSPA
- AFSPA is required to deal with terrorists and insurgents whose stated objective is breaking up the country.
- Many argue that removal of the act will have a demoralising effect on the armed forces.
- Without AFSPA militants may motivate and threaten locals to file lawsuits against the army.
- Army require minimum safeguards from legal harassment and empowerment of its officers to decide on employment of the minimum force that they consider essential.
- AFSPA is necessary to maintain law and order in disturbed areas, otherwise things will go haywire. The law also dissuades advancement of terrorist activities in these areas.

#### Arguments against 
>Human rights activists constantly highlight the view that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) is a draconian act leading to cases of human rights abuses by the security forces. What sections of AFSPA are opposed by the activists? Critically evaluate the requirement with reference to the view held by the Apex Court. #PYMQ 2015
- Abuse of power: It has been alleged that immunity granted by the act has led the armed forces to misuse the powers given to them by this act and commit offences like fake encounters and sexual assault. Justice Santosh Hegde #committee to investigate fake encounters in Manipur described it as a “**symbol of oppression**”.
- Terrorism: It has failed to contain terrorism and restore normalcy in disturbed areas, as the number of armed groups has gone up after the act was established. Many even hold it responsible for the spiralling violence in areas it is in force.
- Threat to fundamental rights: It leads to suspension of fundamental rights and liberties guaranteed to the citizens by the constitution. Thus, it weakens democracy. Human rights violations in AFSPA areas are not inquired into and followed by adequate action. Thus, it is against the principle of natural justice.
- Diminishing credibility of democracy: People’s disillusionment with democratic setup is exploited by secessionists and terror sympathasizers, which leads to more violence & more counter violence creating a vicious cycle.
- Excessive use of force and using it despite having other options to explore.
- The decision of the government to declare a particular area disturbed cannot be challenged in a court of law. Hence, several cases of human rights violations go unnoticed.
- Fake encounter killings in AFSPA declared areas and other atrocities like rape.
- Nagaland Killings in 2021 December. (six locals were killed in a case of mistaken identity)
- SC's 1997 verdict laid down guidelines for use of AFSPA. Court advocated restraint and use of minimum force.

The Justice Jeevan Reddy #committee recommended that it should be repealed and the Unlawful Activities Protection Act strengthened to fight militancy.

#### Observations made by SC
- AFSPA should be only used to supplement the civil authority and not supplant the same by putting in place military administration.
- The Section 6 of AFSPA which precludes any prosecution, suit or legal proceeding against personnel of the security forces is no longer valid if the deaths of civilians are unjustified.
- Every death caused by the armed forces in a disturbed area, be it of a common person or a criminal, should be thoroughly inquired into.
- Use of excessive and arbitrary force is unreasonable be the person a criminal, insurgent, terrorist and militant.
#### Recommendations of the Reddy Committee
- In case the situation so warrants, the state government may request the Union government to deploy the army for not more than six months.
- The Union government may also deploy the armed forces without a request from the state. However, the situation should be reviewed after six months and Parliament’s approval should be sought for extending the deployment.
- Non-commissioned officers may continue to have the power to fire.
- The Union government should set up an independent grievances cell in each district where the Act is in force.
#### Other committees
- Justice Verma Committee: The Justice Verma Committee (2012) recommended to repeal this pointing out the vulnerability of the women in conflict zones such as Kashmir; that there are higher chances of women getting harassed and raped at the hands of Armed Forces in the disturbed areas.
- **2nd ARC** in its fifth report on “Public Order,” recommended repealing AFSPA. It commented that its scrapping would remove sentiments of discrimination and alienation among the people of the North East India.
#### Road to peace
- Rooting out AFSPA totally might create an atmosphere of chaos, and chances of terror attacks will increase.
- The Ministry is waiting for the State governments say on the idea to take a come out with a final verdict.
- Amending the AFSPA act to de-list offences like sexual offence etc. from it and trying them out under other state and national criminal laws.
- Slowly phasing out AFSPA based on threat perception from such areas and strengthening local police and security officers.
	- ![Pasted image 20220828170913.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220828170913.png)
- Proactive role by local government towards real development, especially in social sectors.
- In areas where AFSPA exists, having a robust judicial mechanism withering Army to weed out elements from within who indulge in such violation for promotion and awards.


The issue of the draconian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958 (AFSPA) is once again in news. In this context

# Emerging security threats
- Drone attacks: Explain about drone technology.
	- what are drones? applications - security risks associated with [[Drone technology\|Drones]] - what can be done?
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]] threats, DDOS, attack on IoT devices.
- Chemical, Biological and Radiological Materials.
- **Social engineering and phishing attacks** - Infodemic - fake news, disinformation campaigns on social media
- Terrorists attacks using emerging technologies like - AI and robotics.
- [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] as a security threat - climate refugees and illegal migration
- [[Pandemics\|Pandemics]] and other [[GS 3/DISASTER MANAGEMENT/DISASTER MANAGEMENT TOC\|disasters]]
- [[Threat of terrorism#Lone wolf attacks\|Lone-wolf attacks]]
- Hybrid warfare
- [[Threats to Critical Infrastructure\|Threats to Critical Infrastructure]] 

- How to tackle these challenges?
	- "The government should adopt a policy to collectively deal with the emerging challenges. What is needed is a holistic approach in addressing these emerging non-traditional security issues.
		- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Kerala police forayed (stepped) into the relatively new field of drone forensics after J&K incident 

</div></div>

	- Equip the security forces with modern equipment and involving more youngsters, start-ups and the strategic community in the field.	
		- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



	- DRDO has developed anti-drone technology to shoot down hostile drones in the range of two to three kilometres. 

</div></div>

	- The armed forces should incorporate artificial intelligence, cognitive sciences, robotics, drones, quantum computing, nanotechnology and cyber capabilities as part of the efforts to deal with future challenges.

Various ministries and departments should work on the policy to effectively counter the new and emerging non-traditional security challenges facing the country.

## Hybrid warfare
>Hybrid warfare refers to a combination of conventional and unconventional tactics employed by a state or non-state actor to achieve its strategic goals, which may include political, economic, or military objectives. This includes a mix of conventional warfare, cyber attacks, propaganda, disinformation campaigns, economic coercion, and other non-traditional methods.

### Characteristics of Hybrid Warfare
- Multi Domain: This warfare is a combination of activities, including disinformation, economic manipulation, use of proxies and insurgencies, diplomatic pressure and military actions. Eg: Used by Hezbollah in Israel-Palestine war, 2006.
- Maximum Damage With Minimum Effort: It tends to target areas which are highly vulnerable and where maximum damage can be caused with minimum effort.
- Deploying Non-State Actors: It usually involves non-state actors indulging in subversive roles supported by states in order to exonerate themselves of any involvement if their activities are detected. Eg:- Zhenhua data leak in China.
### Threats Emanating From Hybrid Warfare
- Cyber Attacks: This may include attacks on critical infrastructure like power grids, water supplies, business systems, and defence systems. These may be used to disrupt economic activities, undermine institutions, and discredit political leadership and the intelligentsia.
- Evolving Nature of Terrorism: The idea of Hybrid Warfare encourages new forms of terrorist attacks such as ‘lone-wolf’ attacks and creation of ‘sleeper cells’, which are extremely difficult to detect.
- Engineering young minds through radicalization: This leads to issues like [[GS 1/SOCIETY/Communalism\|Communalism]], Separatism in the long run.
- Undermining Democracy: The foreign governments and other institutions may manipulate the data, spread propaganda and misinformation and influence democratic systems like elections through use of social media, websites, advertisements etc. Eg: Cambridge Analytica incident.
- Disinformation and Fake News: An adversary can create a parallel reality and use fake news to fuel social fragmentation. It could disorient the public and make it difficult for a government to seek public approval for a given policy or operation.
## India's vulnerability to hybrid warfare
- Hybrid warfare is a threat to India's security because it allows adversaries to conduct operations against India without being clearly identifiable as the source of the attack. This can create challenges for India's military and intelligence agencies, which may not be equipped to deal with these new forms of warfare.
- In the context of India, hybrid warfare poses a significant threat due to the country's geopolitical position and its history of conflict with neighboring countries. 
	- For example, Pakistan has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against India by supporting terrorist groups that carry out attacks in India and by using social media to spread disinformation and propaganda.
	- China has also been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against India, including through the use of cyber attacks and propaganda campaigns, as well as by supporting insurgent groups in India's northeast.
- Hybrid warfare also poses a threat to India's critical infrastructure, such as its power grid and transportation systems, which are increasingly reliant on technology and vulnerable to cyber attacks. Such attacks can be difficult to detect and can cause widespread disruption and damage.
- In order to address the threat of hybrid warfare, India must develop a comprehensive strategy that integrates military, economic, and diplomatic measures, as well as efforts to strengthen cybersecurity and counter disinformation campaigns. This will require close collaboration between the government, military, and intelligence agencies, as well as cooperation with international partners.
### Holistic Responses to Combat Hybrid Warfare
- Adopting multinational frameworks: Coordinated and coherent approach to understand, detect and respond to hybrid warfare is required to protect the collective interests of nations. Multinational frameworks should be developed to facilitate cooperation and collaboration across borders.
- Institutional measures: To keep vulnerabilities in check and estimate possible hybrid threats, conducting self-assessments of critical functions and vulnerabilities across all sectors and ensuring regular maintenance. Eg: Regularly upgrading of critical Fintech systems in the country.
- Training of armed forces: Armed forces have a dual role in protecting civilian population and disabling enemy, while countering hybrid warfare. Thus it needs to upgrade itself through various measures like,
	- Training in special battle techniques, as well as conditioning to overcome urban combat stress.
	- Training in use of technological tools such as smart robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
	- Deploying Intelligence tools like Real Time Situational Awareness (RTSA) for precise operations.
- Strengthening the democratic institutions: This helps the government negate various forms of hybrid warfare such as disinformation and radicalization. Inclusion of Civil Society Institutions such as think tanks multiply the government’s capabilities to counter such threats.
- Investing in Journalism to raise media literacy: It has been often reported that uses of the term “hybrid threats” by the media are often inaccurate. As a result, investing in journalism will indirectly help citizens in understanding the threat in a better way.

## Illegal migration as an internal security challenge
- Threat to National Security: The continuance of the illegal immigration of Rohingyas into India and their continued stay in India is found to be having serious national security ramifications and poses serious security threats.
- Clash of Interests: It impacts the interests of local populations in the areas seeing large-scale influxes of illegal immigrants.
- Political Instability: It also increases the political instability when leaders start mobilising the perception of the citizens of the country against the migrants by the elites to grab political power.
- Rise of Militancy: The persistent attacks against the Muslims perceived as illegal migrants in Assam has given way to [[Radicalisation\|radicalisation]] within certain sections of the Muslim community with the formation of militant organisations, such as the Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam (MULTA).
- Human trafficking: In the recent decades, trafficking of women and human smuggling have become quite rampant across the borders.
- Disturbance in Law and Order: The rule of law and integrity of the country are undermined by the illegal migrants who are engaged in illegal and anti-national activities.
### Existing  framework
#### Legal
- **Foreigners Act, 1946**: The act empowered the government to take such steps as are necessary to prevent illegal migrants including the use of force.
	- The concept of ‘burden of proof’ lies with the person, and not with the authorities.
	- The act empowered the government to establish tribunals which would have powers similar to those of a civil court.
	- Recent amendments (2019) to the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 empowered even district magistrates in all States and Union Territories to set up tribunals to decide whether a person staying illegally in India is a foreigner or not. Recently, the Assam government has decided to establish 200 Foreigners’ Tribunals (FTs) for handling cases of people to be excluded from the final [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/CONSTITUTION/CITIZENSHIP#National Register of Citizens NRC\|National Register of Citizens (NRC)]].
- **The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939**: Registration under Foreigners Regional Registration Officer is a mandatory requirement under which all foreign nationals (excluding overseas citizens of India) visiting India on a long term visa (more than 180 days) are required to register themselves with a Registration Officer within 14 days of arriving in India.
- **The Citizenship Act, 1955**: It provides for the acquisition and determination of Indian citizenship. Citizenship amendment act 2019 amends the 1955 Act to provide that the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who entered India on or before December 31, 2014, will not be treated as illegal migrants.
#### Other initiatives
- NRC in Assam: A National Register of Citizens (NRC), containing information for each individual such as the father’s name or husband’s name, nationality, sex, age, means of livelihood, was prepared by the Assam government in 1951. The NRC was aimed to help identify and verify genuine Indian citizens and repatriate foreigners. Now, the Assam government has recently released the updated version of NRC.
- **#operation Push Back**: ==It called for forcible deportation of illegal migrants in India.== The fundamental objective of “Operation Push Back” was to deter any potential Bangladeshi migrant from illegally crossing the border and settling in India.
- Tighter Border Controls: Indian government implemented a series of schemes, such as augmenting the manpower of the border-guarding force, increasing the number of border outposts along the border, constructing fences and issuance of multiple identity cards to border population.
- The India-Bangladesh Border Fence: Fences or barriers are described as “fortified boundaries” and are constructed for enhanced border controls. India is perhaps the first country which has built a border fence to prevent illegal migration.
- Multipurpose Identity Card: In 2010, Aadhar Project was launched to provide a unique identity number to each resident of India and the Unique Identification. Authority of India (UIDAI) was set up to implement the project, which has, till now has generated 19.67 crore Aadhar numbers.

Even though India is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention on refugees and also the 1967 Protocol, it is a signatory to a number of United Nations and World Conventions on Human Rights, refugee issues and related matters. 

Hence its obligations in regard to refugees arise out of the latter. India has also voted affirmatively to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which affirms rights for all persons, citizens and non-citizens alike.

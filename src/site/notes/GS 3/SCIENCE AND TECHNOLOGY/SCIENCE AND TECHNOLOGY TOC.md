# Plasma Technology
>Plasma technology is based on a simple physical principle. Matter changes its state when energy is supplied to it: solids becomes liquid, and liquids becomes gaseous. If even more energy is supplied to a gas, it is ionized and goes into the energy-rich plasma state, the fourth state of matter".

- When plasma comes into contact with solid materials like plastics and metals, its energy acts on the surfaces and changes important properties, such as the surface energy. 
![plasma.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/plasma.jpg)
- Plasma occurs naturally in the sun, the core of stars, quasars, X-ray beam emitting pulsars and supernovas.
- On Earth, plasma naturally occurs in flames, lightning and the auroras.
## Applications of Plasma technology
### For coating and cleaning
- Plasma treatment is most often used to clean, enhance the adhesion qualities of surfaces and produce thin coatings. 
- Plasma technology is a dry, cleanroom-compatible, environmentally friendly alternative to various conventional solvent-based chemical surface treatment methods.
-  In addition, this technology uses no water and fewer chemicals. 
-  Plasma coatings are particularly appropriate for textile-made biomaterials to improve their biocompatibility or improve (or reduce) biological activity on the surface. 
### Applications in health and medicine
-  Among different medical textile applications, surface activation confers hydrophilic properties on wovens and nonwovens used in blood filtration devices or in body fluid filtration membranes. 
-  Other applications include plasma grafting for growth test fabrics, fermentation membranes, implants, catheter fabrics, enzyme immobilization substrates and textile grafts.
-  Plasma Medicine is a growing field that is having an impact in several important areas in therapeutic patient care, combining plasma physics, biology, and clinical medicine. 
-  The most active areas of plasma technology applications are in wound treatment; tissue regeneration; inactivation of pathogens, including biofilms; treating skin diseases; and sterilization
### Plasma technology in waste management
- **Plasma gasification** is an emerging technology which can process landfill waste to extract commodity recyclables and convert carbon-based materials into fuels. It can form an integral component in a system to achieve zero-waste and produce renewable fuels, whilst caring for the environment. 
- Oils spills can be cleaned through **plasma polymerization** which is surface modification using plasma. Recently a team of researchers from Argentine developed a highly hydrophobic with high oil adsorption capacities plasma‐polymerized carbonaceous nanosponge (CN).

# Hyperloop
>Hyperloop is a proposed system of transport that would see pods or containers travel at high speeds through a tube that has been pumped into a near-vacuum.
- The train pods would either float using magnetic levitation technology.
- The pods would be able to travel at immense speeds with a projected top speeds of 760mph.
- The pod would initially launch using an electric motor before levitation takes place and the pod can glide at cruising speed in the low-pressure environment.
![Hyperloop technology.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/Hyperloop%20technology.jpg)
## Major players
- Hyperloop One is the company which is working on this technology, has proposed routes in UK, Netherlands, Finland and Dubai, where it has backing from the governments to explore the potential of the system.
- **Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT):** It was the first company formed in 2013. Currently has a workforce of more than 800 professionals.
- **TransPod:** This is a Canadian company that creates vehicles and tubes similar to the concept of Hyperloop.
- **DGWHyperloop:** It is the only Indian company that is currently working on constructing Hyperloop, connecting Delhi and Mumbai.
- **Hardt Global Mobility:** It is a Dutch team that won at the SpaceX Pod competition and is now working on developing their Hyperloop project in Europe.
- **Zeleros:** It is a Spanish company that won the Hyperloop Pod Competition held in 2016 and is currently developing Hyperloop systems.
- **Hyper Poland:** As the name suggests, it is a company from Poland that also took part in a SpaceX Pod Competition and is building up a model in their country.
## Proposed Hyperloop route in India 
- The proposed Hyperloop route in India will be connecting Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra.
- The proposed system will cut travel time between Mumbai and Pune to 25 minutes from the 3 hours it now takes by road.
- Mumbai-Pune Hyperloop is estimated to connect 26 million people, support 150 million passenger trips per year, and reduce [[Greenhouse gas\|greenhouse gas]] emissions by up to 86,000 tonnes over 30 years.
- The scheme would provide a holistic solution for urban transportation problems ranging from parking policy, congestion pricing to transit-oriented development.
![hyperloop-map India.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/hyperloop-map%20India.jpg)
## Benefits
- Reduce transport time
- Would simplify land acquisition problems
- Cheaper transportation once completely developed
- Eco-friendly
## Challenges

# 3D printing
> 3D printing, or ==additive manufacturing==, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD (computer aided design) model or a digital 3D model.

![3d printing.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/3d%20printing.jpg)
## Advantages of 3D printing
1. Lowers cost
2. Saves time - highly efficient
3. durable and high quality
4. functional models - gives real picture
5. flexibility

## Applications of 3D printing
1. Architecture and construction - actual construction and models - 3D buildings
2. Medicine - prosthetic, hearing aids, artificial organs.
3. Manufacturing of automobiles and parts. eg. cars and aeroplane.
4. Maritime industry - spare parts for ship building.
5. Others - clothing and engineering.

## 3D printing in India
- The government has launched several initiatives such as ‘[[Make in India\|Make in India]]’, ‘[[Digital India\|Digital India]]’ and ‘Skill India’ to improve investment opportunities and to enhance manufacturing capabilities in the country.
- Given the government’s interest in boosting manufacturing, major manufacturers have established 3-D printing assembly lines and distribution centres in partnership with foreign technological firms.
-  A PwC report titled ‘The Global [[Industry 4.0\|Industry 4.0]]’ in 2016 shows that in India, 27% of industries have either already invested or will be investing in AM technology within the next five years.
-  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) will soon come up with a policy aimed at promoting 3D printing on an industrial scale in view of its emerging market.
## Challenges
- Lack of Standards: Since 3D printing is a very niche and new domain, there are no global qualifications and certification norms.
- Hesitation in Adoption: Another challenge is to convince the industry and ministries to push for its adoption in their respective sectors as any new technology, which is not understood easily, faces a tough time.
- Risk of Job Losses: In the initial meetings on the subject, there was a lot of resistance on whether this technology would eat into the jobs of highly-skilled workers in the medical equipment or aerospace technology sectors.
- High Cost: Although actual printing is cheap, parts to build a 3D printer are very expensive as the equipment and manufacturing costs are very high. In addition, there is a concern about warranty hence, resource companies are hesitant to put 3D-printed parts into their machines if they are not covered for damage in case the parts fail.
- Sector Specific Challenges: Globally and even in India, the largest consumer of 3D printing is the automotive industry and right now it is going through changes like the introduction of BS-VI and electric vehicles. New vehicle design development has slowed and so has the demand for 3D printing.

# Geo-Textiles
>Geo-textile is defined as any permeable textile material that is used with foundation, soil, rock earth to increase stability and decrease wind and water erosion
- Have been used from Pharaoh’s time during construction of roads.
- Made of synthetic polymer (polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene and polyamides) or natural-synthetic composite polymer.
![Geotextile.gif](/img/user/Attachments/Geotextile.gif)
## Applications of Geo-textiles
- Civil engineering applications-Roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals etc.
- Sand Dune Armoring- Geo-textile sand filled units to protect upland coastal properties from storm surge, wave action and floods.
- Geo-textiles have been used to protect hominid footprint fossils of Lateoli, Tanzania from erosion, rain and tree roots.
- Stabilization of slopes when quickly establishing vegetation is not possible.
- Natural geo-textiles of coir and jute can be used to establish vegetation, since these degrade into humus and provide erosion blanket of 2-3 and 1-2 years respectively.
- Coir and jute are especially useful in containing wind erosion. Can be used in Chambal badlands, Thar etc. 
	- Recently, the National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA) has announced that coir geo textiles will be used for construction of rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY-III). This would give a boost to the Coir industry hit due to #COVID-19  pandemic.

# Meta-Materials
They are artificially crafted materials with **unique internal microstructures** that give them properties not found in nature.
- Metamaterials are metal-dielectric composites structured on the microscale or nanoscale. 
- **Unique character**: For electromagnetic waves with relatively large wavelengths, the composite structure acts as an array of artificial atoms, giving rise to unique and exotic electromagnetic properties.
- **Applications**: Metamaterials are used in potentially novel applications in antenna and radar design, sub wavelength imaging, and invisibility cloak design.
- Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and University of Nairobi researchers have used meta-materials to improve detection of defects in large structures by **Guided Wave Ultrasound**.

# Science and Technology in India
- India boasts of many contributions such as the ==first use of zero as revealed by the Bakshali manuscript==. 
- However, India now needs to look ahead of its past laurels and move from being a net consumer of knowledge to becoming a net producer as it emerges as one of the world’s largest economies.
- ==According to WIPO, India is the seventh largest patent filing office in the world. However, India produces fewer patents per capita==.
## Current situation
- India has become a major destination for outsourced R&D activities. We currently have more than 1,100 R&D centres set up by MNCs such as IBM, Google, etc.
- Indian scientists are at the forefront of some global groundbreaking work. For example, 37 Indian scientists from nine Indian institutions played a key role in the discovery of gravitational waves that received the Physics Nobel prize in 2017. Indian scientists also contributed to the discovery of a neutron star merger at Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), USA.
- The development of Brahmos, advanced air defence supersonic interceptor missiles, diverse missiles and rocket systems, remotely piloted vehicles, light combat aircraft (LCA), etc., are brilliant examples of India’s progress in strategic and [[Defence technology\|defence technologies]].
- India now ranks amongst a handful of nations that have credible capabilities in the field of space technology. The upgrading from SLV to ASLV and PSLV to GSLV, the first moon orbiter project Chandrayaan-1, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) at the cheapest price and the recent simultaneous launch of 104 satellites are India’s significant achievements.
- India is now the third largest country in terms of the number of start-ups. The government has set up the [[Atal Innovation Mission\|Atal Innovation Mission]] (AIM) to transform radically the innovation, entrepreneurship and start-up ecosystem.
## Importance
- Science, technology, and innovation have instrumental and intrinsic value for society. They are key drivers of economic performance and social well-being.
- It is also important for driving [[scientific temper\|scientific temper]], with its spirit of enquiry, the primacy accorded to facts and evidence, the ability to challenge the status quo, the adherence to norms of discourse and the elevation of doubt and openness.
- The open spirit of inquiry that is fundamental to science can provide a bulwark against the darker forces of dogma, religious obscurantism, and nativism that are threateningly resurfacing around the world.
- It is also essential for human security, for combating [[Climate Change\|climate change]] as well as national security threats ranging from cyber warfare to autonomous military systems such as [[Drone technology\|Drones]].
## Challenges to research in India
- R&D expenditures has remained stagnant at 0.6-0.7% of GDP over the past two decades. This is well below other countries such as US (2.8), China (2.1), Israel (4.3) and Korea (4.2). Central government undertakes almost entire R&D expenditure with limited State government spending but spending by state governments is needed especially for application oriented R&D aimed at problems specific to their economies and populations.
- The share of the private sector in R&D investment in most technologically advanced countries is as high as 65 percent to 75 percent, it is only about 30 percent in India.
- There is a disconnect between the teaching and research enterprise with research being concentrated in specialized research institutes and universities playing largely a teaching role. This has led to a situation where universities have students but need additional faculty support, while research institutes have qualified faculty but are starved of young students.
- Our education system has so far not focused on cultivating a scientific temperament at an early age. In comparison to China, there are less than half Indian STEM PhD students in the US. Fewer students have been enrolling for such degrees either due to lucrative career options after master’s degree or rising work visa challenges.
- Many Indian students prefer to major in engineering rather than science, because of the promise of lucrative industrial career opportunities.
- There has been poor progress in the development and deployment of affordable technologies for rural areas, particularly in agriculture, agro-processing, micro irrigation, etc.
- The public procurement system is heavily biased in favour of experienced and established products and technologies. This strongly discourages new and innovative technologies offered by start-ups, who do not get much-needed support from government procurement.
- “**Lab to Land**” time is too long. Renowned public funded institutions like (CSIR) have developed many frontline technologies. However, the rate of transfer of these technologies to industry and for societal benefits is low.
- The adoption of indigenous innovations by Indian industry is not very encouraging. Frequent violation of **Preferential Market Access (PMA)** is an issue leading to large-scale imports of foreign products and services.
## Governmental efforts
- **Prime Minister Research Fellows (PMRF)**: It is a PPP between Science & Engineering Research Board (SERB) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) which aims to improve the quality of research by attracting the best talents across the country and reduce [[Acceleration of brain drain due to attractive global opportunities\|brain drain]].
- IMPRESS #scheme aims to identify and fund research proposals in social sciences with maximum impact on the governance and society.
- **SPARC** aims to boost joint research with global universities from 28 countries and get international expertise to solve major national problems, train Indian students in the best laboratories.
- IMPRINT is a national initiative of MHRD which aims to address engineering challenges in 10 technology domains relevant to India through an inclusive and sustainable mode.
- [[Atal Innovation Mission\|Atal Innovation Mission]] (AIM) is a flagship initiative set up by the [[NITI Aayog\|NITI Aayog]] to promote innovation and entrepreneurship across the length and breadth of the country.
- India - LIGO
- INO - India Neutrino Observatory
- Science Technology and Innovation policy 2020
	- New policy envisages technological self-reliance and aims to position India among top three scientific superpowers.
	- Our R&D investment in Science hover between .5% and 0.6% of the GDP. Rising it to 2% of GDP has been a national goal for a while.
## Way forward
- India needs to double its national expenditure on R&D with a larger share coming from private sector and universities. The metrics need to go beyond paper and publications to providing value for society.
- The private sector should be incentivised to both undertake and support R&D through CSR ([[Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR)\|Corporate Social Responsibility]]) funds. Government can also partner with private sector to create new R&D funding opportunities such as 50:50 partnerships with Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) for industry relevant research under Ucchtar Avishkar Yojana (UAY).
- Link national labs to universities and create new knowledge ecosystems. Better synergy between universities and research institutes would fill the gaps of faculty support and young talents and ensure deep commitment to excellence.
- India should leverage its [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/INDIAN DIASPORA#Scientific diaspora\|scientific diaspora]]. India has the opportunity to attract back more scientists with growing strength of India’s economy and anti-immigrant atmosphere in some countries. There has been an increase in scientists returning to India. Schemes like INSPIRE, VAJRA can act as a catalyst in leveraging the scientific diaspora. The inducements should be to allow them to do good research. - Take a more mission driven approach to R&D in some areas like agriculture, genomics, cyber physical systems, etc.
- Improve the culture of research. Indian science and research institutes need to inculcate less hierarchical governance systems and encourage risk taking and curiosity in the pursuit of excellence. There should be greater representation of younger scientists in decision making bodies.
- National laboratories and other publicly funded R&D institutions need to make much stronger efforts to engage with the public through the media or through regular tours and lectures and create broad public support for their work.
- To bring vibrancy to frugal innovations, a non-lapsable “**District Innovation Fund**” with a corpus of about INR 2 crore in each district may be created and used to promote grass root innovations.

# Achievements of Indians in Science and technology

## Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman
- C.V. Raman was one of the most famous scientists of India. Raman’s academic brilliance was established at a very young age.
- He had a pioneering work on **scattering of light**, C.V. Raman won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930. He was the first Asian and first non-White to receive any Nobel Prize in the sciences. 
- He discovered that, when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes in wavelength. This phenomenon is now called the **Raman scattering** and is the result of the **Raman Effect**.
	- Raman spectroscopy (named after C. V. Raman) is a spectroscopic technique typically used to determine vibrational modes of molecules, although rotational and other low-frequency modes of systems may also be observed. 
	- Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified.
	- Applications:
		- Medical Diagnostics: it provides a non-contact non-destructive molecular fingerprint of many common physiological biomarkers and is used in cancer detection, identification of pathogens, blood disorders, etc.
			- Recently a Mumbai-based Tata Memorial Centre has turned to Raman Spectroscopy to detect RNA viruses present in saliva samples.
		 - Investigate art and cultural heritage artefacts: it is an efficient and non-destructive way to investigate works of art and cultural heritage artefacts, in part because it is a non-invasive process which can be applied in situ. It can be used to analyze the corrosion products on the surfaces of artefacts (statues, pottery, etc.), which can lend insight into the corrosive environments experienced by the artefacts. The resulting spectra can also be compared to the spectra of surfaces that are cleaned or intentionally corroded, which can aid in determining the authenticity of valuable historical artefacts.
		- Microscopic examination of minerals: Raman spectroscopy offers several advantages for microscopic analysis of minerals (mineralogy), materials such as polymers and ceramics, cells, proteins and forensic trace evidence (anti-crime).
		- Semiconductors: Purity, Alloy composition, Contamination identification, Defect analysis.
		- Life Sciences: Bio-compatibility, DNA/RNA analysis, Metabolic accretions, Single-cell analysis, Characterisation of bio-molecules, bone structure.
		- Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics: Raw material verification, Crystallinity, Contaminant identification etc.
- Raman also worked on the acoustics of musical instruments. He was the first to investigate the harmonic nature of the sound of the Indian drums such as the tabla and the mridangam.

## Narinder Singh Kapany
- He was awarded Padma Vibhushan posthumously in 2021.
- At *Imperial College*, Kapany worked with **Harold Hopkins** on transmission through fibres, achieving good image transmission through a large bundle of optical fibres for the first time in 1953.
- Kapany's research and work encompassed fibre-optics communications, lasers, biomedical instrumentation, solar energy and pollution monitoring.
	- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- The term was coined by Indian-American physicist **Narinder Singh Kapany**, who is widely acknowledged as the father of fiber optics. 

</div></div>

	- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

# India's achievements in space
Despite of numerous hurdles, India has effectively advanced space technology and has applied it fruitfully for its rapid socio-economic development. Indian space programme began in 1962, with the formation of **INCOSPAR** (Indian National Committee for Space Research) under the leadership of **Dr. Vikram Sarabhai**. 

ISRO was set up in 1969 August 15 (Bangalore HQ), which is now under ==Under Department of Space==, for the rapid development of space technology and its applications. It is one of the six largest space agencies in the world.
Over the last 5 decades Indian space program has made impressive progress through a ==well integrated, self reliant program==.

## Main objectives of Indian space program
1. Satellites for communication and remote sensing
	- Mass communication and education via satellite
		- INSAT - Indian National Satellite System for telecommunication, television broadcasting, and meteorological services.
		- Established in 1983 with commissioning of INSAT-1B.
		- The INSAT system has more than 200 transponders in the C, Extended C and Ku-bands
	- Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) for monitoring and management of natural resources and Disaster Management Support. EOS - Earth Observation Satellites - for real time monitoring of natural disasters, water bodies and crops, forest cover changes etc. 
		- The data is used for several applications covering agriculture water resources urban planning, [[Rural Development\|Rural Development]], mineral prospecting, forestry, drought and flood forecasting, ocean resources and disaster management.
		- Started with IRS-1A in 1988
		- e.g. OceanSat, CartoSat, ResourceSat 
2. Development of indigenous satellites and satellite launch vehicles. (space transportation system)
3. Application programme. (e.g. Navigation Program - IRNSS)
4. Space science and exploration.

## Major milestones in Indian Space Programme
- Indian Space Programme began at ==Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS)== located at Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram. 
	- Thumba was selected as a rocket launching station because ==geomagnetic equator of the earth passes over Thumba==. 
	- On November 21, 1963, the first sounding rocket, **Nike-Apache** (was procured from the USA) was launched from Thumba. 
		- **A sounding rocket is a rocket, which is intended for assessing the physical parameters of the upper atmosphere**.
- **Aryabhata - First Indian Satellite** was launched on April 19, 1975 from the former Soviet Union. It provided India with the basis of learning satellite technology and designing.
- First Experimental launch of SLV-3 with Rohini Technology Payload on board (August 10, 1979). Satellite could not be placed in orbit. **Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) is the first launch vehicle of India**.
- **Ariane Passenger Payload Experiment (APPLE)**, an experimental geo-stationary communication satellite was successfully launched on June 19, 1981. It became the forerunner for future communication satellite system.
- On April 2, 1984, the first Indo-Soviet crewed space mission was launched. **Rakesh Sharma** became the first and only Indian citizen to go into space. He flew aboard in the Soviet rocket **Soyuz T-11**, as part of a three member Soviet-Indian crew.
- PSLV-C11 successfully launched CHANDRAYAAN-1, first Indian planetary science and exploration mission from Sriharikota on October 22, 2008.

## Launch vehicles
- ![Pasted image 20220526104516.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220526104516.png)
### PSLV
- Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is the third generation launch vehicle of India. 
- ==Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is one the most reliable and affordable launch vehicles.== 
- It is the first Indian launch vehicle to be equipped with liquid stages.
- After its first successful launch in October 1994, PSLV emerged as the reliable and versatile workhorse launch vehicle of India with 39 consecutively successful missions by June 2017. 
- During 1994-2017 period, the vehicle has launched 48 Indian satellites and 209 satellites for customers from abroad.
- ==It has become the favorite launch vehicle of developed nations also. Its low cost and high reliability has gained it worldwide preference.==
- Launch of 104 satellites by PSLV has set a world record.
- Besides, the vehicle successfully launched two spacecraft – Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and Mars Orbiter Spacecraft in 2013 - traveled to Moon and Mars respectively.
- PSLV is mainly used to launch IRS in sun synchronous polar orbit and geosynchronous transfer orbit. Carry comparatively lighter satellites.

### GSLV
GSLV - for heavy - mainly communication satellites. 
- 3 stage 
	- 1st - solid fuel
	- 2nd - liquid
	- 3rd - cryogenic
		- Cryogenic stage is more efficient and provides more thrust for every kg of propellant it burns as compared to other stages. **specific impulse** - a measure of efficiency is high.
		- Liquid h2 and liquid o2 (at very low temp)

#### GSLV MK III 
- Capable or carrying up to 4000 kg.
- 3 stage launch vehicle
- Chandrayaan-2&3 and Gaganyaan
- Nicknamed as 'Bahubali among Indian Launch vehicles'.
#### LVM3
- Launch Vehicle Mark 3 - modified version of GSLV MK III
- Successfully placed 36 satellites of OneWeb consortium.

### Sounding Rockets
- Sounding rockets are **one or two stage solid propellant rockets** used for probing the upper atmospheric regions and for space research. 
- They also serve as easily affordable platforms to test or prove prototypes of new components or subsystems intended for use in launch vehicles and satellites. 
- With the establishment of the **Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS)** in 1963 at Thumba, a location close to the magnetic equator, there was a quantum jump in the scope for aeronomy and atmospheric sciences in India. 
- The launch of the first sounding rocket from Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala on 21 November 1963, marked the beginning of the Indian Space Programme.
- ISRO started launching indigenously made sounding rockets from 1965 and experience gained was of immense value in the mastering  of solid propellant technology. 
- In 1975, all sounding rocket activities were consolidated under the **Rohini Sounding Rocket (RSR) Programme**. RH-75, with a diameter of 75mm was the first truly Indian sounding rocket, which was followed by RH-100 and RH-125 rockets.
- The sounding rocket programme was the bedrock on which the edifice of launch vehicle technology in ISRO could be built. 
- It is possible to conduct coordinated campaigns by simultaneously launching sounding rockets from different locations.
- It is also possible to launch several sounding rockets in a single day.

### Future launchers
#### Scramjet Engine-TD
- The Scramjet engine designed by ISRO uses **Hydrogen as fuel** and the oxygen from the atmospheric air as the oxidiser.  - This test was the maiden short duration experimental test of ISRO’s Scramjet engine with a hypersonic flight at Mach 6.
- Development of fuel efficient Scramjet engine is considered as a feat which would further decrease the cost and allow launch of heavier satellites at lesser cost.
#### Reusable Launch Vehicle – Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD)
- Reusable Launch Vehicle – Technology Demonstrator (RLV-TD) is one of the most technologically challenging endeavors of ISRO towards developing essential technologies for a fully reusable launch vehicle to enable low cost access to space.
- Combines the complexity of both launch vehicles and aircraft.
- Built at a low cost of 95 crores, the Reusable Launch Vehicle by ISRO was meant to reduce the cost of satellites by reusing the space shuttles.
- The future rockets are meant to be reusable. Only a small part of the rocket would be destroyed during the mission. The bulk of it would re-enter the earth’s atmosphere and land very much like an airplane, and can be used in future missions. 
- Reusable rockets would cut down on costs and energy, and also reduce space debris, which is becoming a serious problem because of the large number of launches.
#### NGLV
- Next-Gen Launch Vehicle - cost efficient, 3 stage semi-cryogenic (refined kerosene as fuel with liquid oxygen(LOX))
- Reusable heavy-lift vehicle.
- Payload capacity of 10 tonnes to GTO
## International and regional cooperation
- [[Space diplomacy\|Space diplomacy]]
- SAARC -  South Asian satellite - GSAT9 - part of [[GS 2/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS/BASICS OF FOREIGN POLICY#Neighborhood first\|neighborhood first policy]].
- **Outer space treaty of 1967** creates certain obligation such as peaceful uses of outer spaces, promoting international cooperation in outer space activities, non weaponisation of outer space etc. on a member state.
	- Recent developments - **Mission Shakti** and EMISAT - weaponisation and militarization of space.

## Future Missions of ISRO
### Indian Data Relay Satellite System (IDRSS)
- The IDRSS is planned to track and be constantly in touch with Indian satellites, in particular those in low-earth orbits which have limited coverage of earth.
- In the coming years, it will be vital to ISRO whose roadmap is dotted with advanced LEO missions such as space docking, space station, as well as distant expeditions to moon, Mars and Venus.
- It will also be useful in monitoring launches.
- The first beneficiary would be the prospective crew members of the Gaganyaan mission of 2024 who can be fully and continuously in touch with mission control throughout their travel.
- IDRSS satellites of the 2,000 kg class would be launched on the GSLV launcher to geostationary orbits around 36,000 km away.

### Indian Space Station Programme
- In 2019 ISRO announced its plans to set up its own space station in “five to seven years” after successfully launching its first human spaceflight mission. 
- Then ISRO chairperson K Sivan had said it would be an extension of the spaceflight programme, with the space station weighing about 20 tonnes and having the capacity to house astronauts for about 15-20 days in the low earth orbit.
- ISRO is working to develop spacecraft docking and berthing technology, with an initial funding of ₹10 crore cleared in 2017.
- A Space Docking Experiment, or **SPADEX**, is being worked out by ISRO with systems like signal analysis equipment, high-precision videometer for navigation, docking system electronics and real-time decision making for landing systems being developed in various stages. 
- As part of SPADEX, ISRO will launch 2 small satellites for testing. This technology is crucial for a space station as it will enable transfer humans from one vehicle or spacecraft to another.

# SPACE POLLUTION
>It is estimated that there are 128 million pieces of space debris, that are larger than 1mm in Earth's orbit. Which are very dangerous, since they move in high velocity. #facts #introduction 

## Gravity of the issue
- Space junk is not a theoretical concept but a reality, similar to the threat posed by [[Marine Plastic pollution\|islands of plastic floating in our oceans]].
- Earth’s orbit is home to more than 3,500 defunct satellites and an estimated 750,000 smaller fragments.
- Since 2019, there have been more than 5,000 satellites, but only 2,000 are still active. 
- **Kessler syndrome** postulates that crashes would first be seen between fragments and larger objects like satellites and would eventually be between two fragments. Crashes will continue till the debris becomes very small.

## Two major regions of clutter
1. low earth orbit - used by ISS, Hubble space telescope,  manned missions etc.
2. geostationary orbit - used by communications, weather and surveillance satellites.

## Steps taken to address the issue
### International laws
- There is **no binding international legal rule** (yet) which prohibits the wanton creation of space debris.
- **1967 Outer Space Treaty** bars states party to the treaty from placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit.
- Since 2002, the world's space powers have complied with an informal code of conduct to avoid the creation of space junk and the **United Nations has endorsed a resolution along those lines.**
### Missions and Projects for the removal of debris
- There have been several initiatives to remove debris like **global mitigation measures** by **Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space**, and Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) ;  **e-Deorbit mission** of European space agency etc.  However RemoveDEBRIS mission launched by European Union is a significant one.
- ISRO initiated a project called Project NETRA, which is an early warning system in space to detect debris and other hazards to Indian satellites.

#### RemoveDEBRIS Mission
The RemoveDEBRIS mission is led by the **Surrey Space Centre (SSC)** at the University Of Surrey, UK, and is co-funded by **the European Commission and other partners**, including prominent European space companies and institutions.

Rather than engaging in active debris removal (ADR) of real space debris, the RemoveDEBRIS mission plan is to **test the efficacy of several ADR technologies** on mock targets in low Earth orbit.

- It showcases four methods of capturing artificial debris targets.
- The targets are two CubeSats (miniaturized satellites provided by the SSC) that are carried inside the main platform.
	- The first demonstration involves a net **that is deployed (net capture)** at the target CubeSat.
	- The second experiment sees the use of a **harpoon, which is launched at a target plate made of “representative satellite panel materials".** This is a first-of-its-kind harpoon capture in orbit.
	- The third experiment using the other CubeSat **involves vision-based navigation**. Using cameras and [[LiDAR\|LiDAR]] (light detection and ranging), the platform sends data about the debris back to the ground for processing.
	- The fourth experiment sees the RemoveDEBRIS spacecraft deploy **a large dragsail** to speed up its de-orbiting process. As it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the spacecraft will burn up, leaving no debris behind

##### ISRO’S Project NETRA and it’s significance
ISRO has commenced **Project NETRA** or **Network for space object Tracking and Analysis**, which aims to safeguard the country’s Low-Earth Orbit satellites from space debris.

- NETRA is a network of observational tools like telescopes and radars, which will be connected to a data processing units and a control centre. 
- The system will improve India’s space situational awareness.
- The NETRA would prevent danger from space debris.
- NETRA will initially focus on satellites in Low-Earth Orbit, but will aim to one day scan debris in Geostationary Orbit, which would enhance ISRO’s capabilities. 
- With this the ISRO, which has placed satellites to track the earth from above, will also start training its eyes on space from earth.
- ISRO currently depends on NORAD-North American Aerospace Defense Command-to detect potential threats to its satellites in space. NETRA will remove ISRO’s dependence on NORAD and allow it to become self-dependent.
- The SSA also has a military quotient to it and adds a new ring to the country’s overall security, as space and defence experts read it. It will serve as an unstated warning against missile or space attack for the country.

The space debris problem is an issue that needs a worldwide cooperation to solve it. India, as a responsible space power, and as a part of a national capability, deployed NETRA that would help in reducing threat from space debris. 

This is a vital requirement for protecting our space assets and would act as a force multiplier. Apart from radars and telescopes, India should also think of deploying satellites that track other satellites, as the U.S. and other space powers had done.

</div></div>

- Clean and affordable energy for space missions.
- ==India's share is less in space industry. Only 2% of total 450 billion dollar industry.== 
## Way forward
- More funding to space sector.
- Private investment, FDI, [[Private participation in Space\|Private participation in Space]] - [[Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)\|Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)]]
- An independent tribunal to adjudicate disputes among private space entities.
- Need for a **National Space Law**.
- Expanding international cooperation - SPACE DIPLOMACY
- Doing away with the bureaucratic hassles: CRYOGENIC ENGINE DEVELOPMENT was delayed for decades due to bureaucratic hassles.
- Peaceful use of outer space.
- Creation of attractive environment for brain gain.
- More fund allocation to R&D for capacity building.
- Projects like UNNATI, YUVIKA.
- Joint research and collaboration with Universities.


==Such reforms are need of the hour to ensure a bright Indian future in space.==

# Cloud computing
>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. ==Cloud is just a metaphor for the internet.== #definition #introduction 

- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, (parent company of Google)	 are the technology giants that provide cloud computing infrastructure to major corporates and governments.
- Hybrid cloud platform - IBM
## Types of Cloud computing
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Network as a Service (NaaS)
## Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. Efficient : It will make use of existing infrastructure, thereby reducing duplication of cost and effort.
2. Cost reduction : Flexibility in hardware and software i.e., pay as you use.
3. Location independence : It can be accessible from anywhere.
4. Re-usability : App developed by one department can be reused by another with customisation.
5. Better service delivery : It will lead to faster service delivery with less chances of error, like in DBT.
## Challenges of cloud computing
1. Data security.
2. Need for high speed internet connection (essentially a big constraint for a country like ours).
3. Universal standardisation required which makes interoperability among providers difficult as of now.
4. Dependence on service providers even for trivial applications.

# Edge computing
>Edge computing is computing that’s done at or near the source of the data such as laptops, tablets, instead of relying on the cloud. (It doesn’t mean the cloud will disappear. It means the cloud is coming to you.) #definition #introduction 

- It is an **extension of [[Cloud computing\|cloud computing]]**. 
- Edge Computing enables data to be analysed, processed, and transferred at the edge of a network. The data will be analysed locally, closer to where it is stored, in real-time without latency, rather than send it far away to a centralised data centre.
- The global edge computing market is forecasted to reach more than **$ 8 Billion by 2025** valued growing at more than 32% between 2019-2025.
- Nvidia, a big player in the design and manufacture of graphics and AI acceleration hardware, has announced its **EGX edge computing platform**.
- Self driving cars can be considered as a good example of edge computing.
## Advantages of Edge Computing
- Quick : allows for **quicker data processing** and **content delivery**
- Future Technology Enabled : Technologies such as [[5G\|5G]] wireless technology, [[Internet of Things (IoT)\|Internet of Things (IoT)]] and [[Artificial Intelligence\|artificial intelligence]] enable faster response times, lower latency (delay), and simplified maintenance in computing.
- Localised solution : It is **preferred over cloud computing in remote locations,** where there is limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. These locations require local storage, similar to a mini data centre, with edge computing providing the perfect solution for it.
- Data Efficient : That data doesn’t need to be sent over a network as soon as it processed; only important data is sent. Therefore, an edge computing network reduces the amount of data that travels over the network.
- Data Security and privacy : Most of the data is processed and stored locally, like Biometric details.
## How is edge computing different from cloud computing?
- Basic difference between these two lies in where the data processing takes place.
	- At the moment, the existing Internet of Things (IoT) systems perform all of their computations in the cloud using data centres.
	- On the other hand, Edge Computing manages the massive amounts of data generated by IoT devices by storing and processing data locally.
- Unlike in cloud computing, data doesn’t need to be sent over a network as soon as it processed; only important data is sent. So it reduces data traffic and saves bandwidth compared to cloud computing.

## Challenges associated with Edge computing
- Physical security of the devices: devices would be more vulnerable to malicious attacks
- [[Monopoly of Big Tech companies\|Monopoly of Big Tech companies]] and more control over users' lives.

Experts believe the true potential of edge computing will become apparent when 5G networks go mainstream in the coming future. Users will be able to enjoy consistent connectivity without even realising it.

# Super computers
>Super computer is a computer or an array of computers that act as one collective machine and capable of processing enormous amounts of data. #definition #introduction 
- Performance of super computing is measured in floating point operations per second (FLOPS).
## Advantages of Super Computers
- They work at very high speeds and perform complex jobs such as nuclear research or forecasting weather patterns.
- It channels all its power into executing a few programs as fast as possible simultaneously.
- It uses parallel processing instead of the serial processing in the case of an ordinary computer.
	 - Serial processing: you take a list of items and do whatever you want to do with them one by one. It will take as long to complete the task as there are items in your list.
	 - Parallel processing will take tasks as units and do simultaneously.
## Application areas
- **Climate Modeling**: Weather Prediction. Paths of hurricanes and the probability of tornado strikes. India has become the only country worldwide to have an **Ensemble Prediction System (EPS)**, running weather models at a 12-km resolution due to **Pratyush**.
- **Seismic Analysis**: Disaster Simulations and Management.
- **Data Mining**: Extract information from raw data gathered on the ground. For example, businesses can analyze data collected from their cash registers to help control inventory or spot market trends.
- **Scientific Research**: For example, Researchers at CERN, found the **Higgs-Boson** particle by analysing the massive amounts of data generated by the **Large Hadron Collider (LHC)**.
- Computational Biology and Computational Chemistry and Molecular Dynamics like Atomic Energy Simulations.
- Discoveries beyond Earth (Astrophysics).
- [[Big data\|Big data analytics]]
- Finance.

# Quantum computing
>Quantum computing make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data. #definition #introduction 

- Classical computers encode information in bits. Each bit can take the value of 1 or 0 - These 1s and 0s act as on/off switches that ultimately drive computer functions. 
- Quantum computers, on the other hand, are based on **qubits**, which operate according to two key principles of quantum physics: ==superposition and entanglement.==
	- Superposition means that each qubit can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time.
	- Entanglement means that qubits in a superposition can be correlated with each other i.e. the state of one (whether it is a 1 or a 0) can depend on the state of another. 
		- In quantum entanglement, subatomic particles become “entangled” (linked) in such a way that any change in one disturbs the other even if both are at opposite ends of the universe.
- **Quantum supremacy** means that researchers have been able to use a quantum computer to perform a single calculation that no conventional computer, even the biggest supercomputer, can perform in a reasonable amount of time. 
	- Google’s quantum computer, named **Sycamore**, claimed ‘**supremacy**'.
	- A 2018 experiment out of Paris has demonstrated, for the first time, that quantum communication is superior to classical ways of transmitting information.
- **Quantum threat** : The world faces a new scare that some scientists are calling the Y2Q (“years to quantum") moment. Y2Q, say experts, could be the next major Cyber disruption.
	- ![LSChart_1579018676205 1.png](/img/user/Attachments/LSChart_1579018676205%201.png)

## Applications of Quantum Technology
Quantum Technologies not just have ultra fast computing capabilities, but it also has **strategic and economic advantages**.
- **Secure Communication:** China recently demonstrated secure quantum communication links between terrestrial stations and satellites.  
	- This area is significant to satellites, military and [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]] among others as it promises unimaginably fast computing and safe, unhackable satellite communication to its users.
- **Research:** It can help in solving some of the fundamental questions in physics related to gravity, black hole etc. 
	- Similarly, the quantum initiative could give a big boost to the [[Genome Sequencing#Genome India Initiative\|Genome India Inititative]], a collaborative effort of 20 institutions to enable new efficiencies in life sciences, agriculture and medicine.
- **Disaster Management:** Tsunamis, drought, earthquakes and floods may become more predictable with quantum applications.  
	- The collection of data regarding climate change can be streamlined in a better way through quantum technology. This in turn will have a profound impact on agriculture, food technology chains and the limiting of farmland wastage.
- **Pharmaceutical:** India’s interest in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry is huge.  
	- Quantum computing could reduce the time frame of the discovery of new molecules and related processes to a few days from the present 10-year slog that scientists put in.
	- For instance, tracking protein behaviour or even modeling new proteins with the help of quantum computers could be made easier and faster.
	- Tackling chronic diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s and heart ailments is a big possibility of the technology.
- **Augmenting [[INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\|Industrial revolution]] 4.0:** Quantum computing is an integral part of [[INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\|Industrial revolution]] 4.0.  
	- Success in it will help in Strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging other [[INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\|Industrial revolution]] 4.0 technologies like the [[Internet of Things (IoT)\|Internet of Things (IoT)]], [[Machine learning\|Machine learning]], robotics, and [[Artificial Intelligence\|Artificial Intelligence]] across sectors will further help in laying the foundation of the Knowledge economy.
## India's Effort
- Globally, research in this area is about two decades old, but in India, serious experimental work has been under way for only about five years.
- In 2018, the government initiated serious discussions in quantum technologies and kick started research projects across 51 organisations under **QUEST – Quantum Enabled Science and Technology.** However, no significant progress is made in this field until NMQTA.
	-	Department of Science & Technology (DST), set up a research project named Quantum-Enabled Science & Technology (QuEST), with ₹80 crores ($11.2 million) in funding, at an institute in Hyderabad.
- One lab set up at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay is dedicated to quantum technology.
- Union Budget 2020-21 proposed to spend ₹8,000 crore ($ 1.2 billion) on the newly launched **National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (NMQTA).** The mission seeks to develop quantum computing linked technologies amidst the second quantum revolution and ==make India the world’s third biggest nation in the sector after the US and China==.
### National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (NMQTA)
- The new mission will coordinate the work of scientists, industry leaders and government departments. 
- One aim is to develop a 50-qubit computer within 4-5 years. This is ambitious, but certainly achievable given the strengths of the Indian ICT sector.
- Aerospace engineering, numerical weather prediction, secure communications, cryptography, financial transactions, [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]], advanced manufacturing, health, and agriculture are examples of sectors where India would like to spearhead scientific breakthroughs and boost quantum technology-led economic growth.
### Why is India lagging behind?
- Ill-equipped ecosystem : India doesn’t have enough people working on quantum technology, only 100-200 researchers working in this field.
- ==India’s legacy problem : strong on theory, but weak in hardware.== That has a direct impact on the country’s ability to advance in building quantum technology. 
	- QNu Labs is trying to fill that gap.
- Private sector participation and investment remains lacklustre. 
	- Indian tech giants like Wipro and Infosys need to step in. They have many engineers on the bench who can be involved. Academia alone or DST-funded projects can’t compete with giants like IBM.
	- R&D is good for building prototypes. But industry partnership is crucial for implementing it in the real world.
- Funding crunch.
	- ![LSChart_1579018676206.png](/img/user/Attachments/LSChart_1579018676206.png)
- Lack of a coordinated effort. There are many isolated communities in India working on various aspects: quantum hardware, quantum key distribution, information theory and other fields,
- Quantum requires many kinds of expertise, and that is needed under one roof. We need an equivalent of ISRO (for space) and BARC (for atomic research) for quantum."	  	 	 		 	
## Associated Challenges
- The challenge lies in harnessing the properties of quantum superposition in a highly controlled manner. 
	- The qubits tend to be very fragile and lose their “quantumness” if not controlled properly. Also, a careful choice of materials, design and engineering is required to get them to work.
- On the theoretical front lies the challenge of creating the algorithms and applications for quantum computers.
- Information technology-based security infrastructure would never be the same once quantum systems become a reality, given the ultra fast speed of computing power.
- Warfare and conflict strategists will have new challenges to face.   
	- In such scenarios India's current plans may have to be reworked to develop integrated war-theatre strategies factoring in quantum technologies.
## Way Forward
- An unprecedented collaboration between physicists (both experimentalists and theorists), computer scientists, material scientists and engineers.
- Government needs to partner institutions and the scientific community to work out details of the mission and roll it out quickly.
- Private funding, both via industry and philanthropy, can play an outsized role even with much smaller amounts.  
	- For example, unrestricted funds that can be used to attract and retain high quality workforce and to build international networks - all at short notice - can and will make an enormous difference to the success of this enterprise.
	- This is one of the most effective ways (as China and Singapore discovered) to catch up scientifically with the international community, while quickly creating a vibrant intellectual environment to help attract top researchers.

#### Kamakoti Committee
AI Task Force headed by **V.Kamakoti** was set up to to explore possibilities to leverage AI for development across various fields.  

Key recommendations of the #committee were 
- Set up digital data banks, marketplaces and exchanges to ensure availability of cross-industry information.  
- Data ombudsman: to address data-related issues and grievances.
- Ensure availability of funds for R&D
- Setting up **National Artificial Intelligence Mission** (N-AIM)
## Challenges
1. India does not have a comprehensive legislation to regulate this growing industry.
2. Low intensity of AI research. A recent [[NITI Aayog\|NITI Aayog]] paper estimates that it has only around 50 top-notch AI researchers, concentrated in elite institutions like the IITs.
3. There is lack of quality data in building smart AI tools. India lacks this in sectors such as agriculture and health.
4. High resource cost and low awareness for adopting AI in business processes.
5. Unclear privacy, security and ethical regulations. Predicting and analysing legal issues and their solutions is not that simple. Criminal law is going to face drastic challenges. What if an AI based driverless car gets into an accident that causes harm to humans or damages property? Who should the courts hold liable for the same?
6. Unattractive Intellectual Property regime to incentivise research and adoption of AI.
7. The usage of AI can lead to loss of traditional jobs.
8. AI is still long way from surpassing human intelligence. It may induce apathy in governance and may fail to comprehend diversity of problems faced by people needing instant customisation.
9. Requirement of massive computational facility
10. Digital exclusion, discrimination on the basis increased surveillance.
## Way forward
- Incentivising Core and Applied research in AI. Introducing AI /[[Machine learning\|ML]] in schools and colleges.
- Creation of Centres of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence.
- Accelerating Adoption of AI across the value chain in industries.
- Digital literacy and AI skilling with special focus on urban areas. Upgrade of existing systems so they are better integrated with AI so that errors and chaos doesn’t occur later.
- Establish a **data protection framework** with legal backing.
- Should be initially used only in domains where processes are well defined and have lesser human interface.
- Bring all stakeholders on board like workers, civil society etc., before its induction.
- Should be catalyst for local technology solutions and manufacturing rather than imports.

The way ahead is to factor in current strengths and weaknesses in AI and initiate large-scale transformational interventions, primarily led by the government, with the private sector providing able support.

The above challenges, if addressed in an expeditious manner through concerted collaborative efforts, with government playing a leading role, could lead to fundamental building blocks that form the core to India’s march towards leadership in AI.

# 5G
  >5G is the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. It succeeds the 4G (LTE/WiMax), 3G (UMTS) and 2G (GSM) systems. ==It's a high frequency (GHz range) low wavelength spectrum of communication.==  The 5G frequency bands in India include: 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz, and 26 GHz #definition #introduction 

 ## What is 5G?
- 5th generation of cellular mobile communication.
- Previous generations
	- 1g - 1980-82 in USA
	- 2g - GSM in Finland in 1992
	- 3g - Japan in 2001. - 0.2mbps - video. history of mobile apps began.
	- 4g - Improved speed
![Pasted image 20201022145140.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020201022145140.png)
## Development of 5g across the world
Every country is looking at 5G as a technology to boost economic development.
- China officially announced 5g Era, China Japan and Korea are on the leading front.
- USA, AUSTRALIA And Canada  - concerned about privacy and Cyber security.
- India responded with ambitious actions. 
	- India is expected to be world's second largest smartphone market by 2025 with around 1 billion installed devices. 88 million going to be 5g enabled devices.
## Benefits of 5g technology
5g would drive future automation, AI, driverless cars, drones.
- 5G performance targets high data rate, reduced latency, energy saving, cost reduction, higher system capacity, and massive device connectivity.
- Till now cellular mobile communications were used mainly for mobile communication. 5G is also for industrial development.
- Speed: At least 10 times (up to 20) faster than current 4g system. 
	- HD movies can be downloaded in seconds. we will be watching 4k videos, without buffering. - boost to entertainment.
- More reliable.
- **Low communication latency**:
	-  Latency is the time it takes to pass a message from sender to receiver. Low communication latency is one improvement in 5G. Lower latency could help 5G mobile networks enable things such as multiplayer mobile gaming, factory robots, self-driving cars and other tasks demanding quick response. #definition 
- Enables new Applications: like IoT, Driverless cars, nanobots etc.
- Will improve overall connectivity in India.
- New and efficient transportation.
- Improved energy efficiency.
- Revolutionize education sector.
- Smart agriculture.
- Smart Governance.
## Challenges and Demerits
- **Technical**: Milli metre waves are absorbed by gases in the atmosphere and have shorter range than microwaves, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size; 5G cells will be the size of a city block, as opposed to the cells in previous cellular networks which could be many miles across. 
	- The waves also have trouble passing through building walls, requiring multiple antennas to cover a cell. Milli metre wave antennas are smaller than the large antennas used in previous cellular networks, only a few inches long, so instead of a cell tower 5G cells will be covered by many antennas mounted on telephone poles and buildings.
- **Economical**: Implementation of 5G will cost enormous and unjustifiable capital investment. 
	- Deployment is currently limited to cities, where there will be enough users per cell to provide an adequate investment return, and there are ==doubts about whether this technology will ever reach rural areas.==
- **Security and Privacy**: [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]], [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]] issues, Surveillance.
- **Impact on environment and Health**: 
	- any technology improve communication reduce carbon emission, [[Greenhouse gas\|GHG]] etc.  so 5g would be environment friendly. (comparatively)
	- Adverse effects of 5g radiation.
	- Higher power concentrated on small areas.
	- harmful effects of electro-magnetic radiations. collapse of insect population. e.g.  **colony collapse of Bees.**
	- Retinal damage, neurological issues, cancer risks, etc.
- **Political**: Other potential tricky issues could relate to whether Huawei, which is currently the prime target in the US - China technology war, is allowed to participate in the 5G trials (telecom) in India.
## Need for a Desi 5G model
For inclusive and supportive of health care, education and farming.
- Indian players must be proactive, because country's appetite for mobile tech is going to be huge.
- we missed out opportunities around 2G, 3G and 4G.
- India has become the second biggest mobile manufacturer in the world.
- Qualcomm, And Bharati Airtel is tying up for 5G in India.

- India excluded, Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE in 5G trails. We cannot have bloodshed on border, good relationship in other domains : External Affairs Minister. 

</div></div>

## Issues
- India unprepared for 5g roll-out - Parliamentary panel.
	- Factors coming in the way
		- Inadequate availability of spectrum
		- high spectrum prices
		- poor development of use cases
		- low status fiberisation

# Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of things is the extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects. Embedded with electronics, Internet connectivity, and other forms of hardware, these devices can communicate and interact with others over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled.
	
- according to a Survey by HP, No of connected devices in -
	- 1990 - 0.3 million
	- 2013 - 9 billion
	- 2025 - 1.0 trillion
## Applications
- smart home
- wearables
- smart cities
- IoT in agriculture : Real-time weather and soil alerts, crop advisory services, connected tools such as autonomous tractors and harvesters and personalized micro-financing can revolutionize agriculture.
- connected cars
- smart retail
- Healthcare : Smart pills and medical wearables can make diagnostic and prescriptive healthcare affordable and accessible. **IoMT - Internet of Medical Things** - connected infrastructure of medical devices, softwares and health systems and services.
## Impact of IoT on the day to day life:
- Car-Calendar Connection: Say for example you are on your way to a meeting; your car could have access to your calendar and already know the best route to take. If the traffic is heavy your car might send a text to the other party notifying them that you will be late.
- Alarm Clock-Coffee Maker Connection: What if your alarm clock wakes up you at 6 a.m. and then notifies your coffee maker to start brewing coffee for you?
- IoT and Google’s Driverless Car: The car has multiple devices which track the movement of objects, captures the images surrounding it and processes the information. It has devices on board that can change the speed and direction of movement depending on the feedback it gets from the external environment. The data is then backed-up on a cloud from which it can receive instructions and behave accordingly, right from throttle accelerator to applying brakes.
## Impact of IoT on Governance:
On a broader scale, the IoT can be applied to things like transportation networks: “smart cities” which can help us reduce waste and improve efficiency for things such as energy use; this helping us understand and improve how we work and live.

## IoT in India
Government of India’s IoT Announcement, has come out with a ==draft IOT Policy document== which focuses on following objectives:
 To create an IoT industry in India of USD 15 billion by 2020. It has been assumed that India would have a share of 56% of global IoT industry.
 To undertake capacity development  Human & Technology) for IoT specific skill-sets for domestic and international markets.
 To undertake Research & development for all the assisting technologies.
 To develop IoT products specific to Indian needs in all possible domains.

### Recent Initiatives
 Government is coming up with a regulatory framework for Internet-of-Things IoT along with policies to promote the sector.
 Department of Telecom has come out with a machine-to-machine M2M roadmap, with an aim to put regulators, industry agencies that develop standards, users and manufacturers on the same page.
 The Department of Electronics & Information Technology DeitY, in its draft policy, targets to create an IoT industry in India of $15 billion by 2020.
 Currently, work is going on in the area of numbering schemes for IoT and KYC norms for SIM-embedded M2M devices.
 Telecom Standards Society of India too is working on India-relevant standards with respect to the sector.

### areas where commercial IoT adoption can grow in India
Commercial IoT has much better prospects in India. Even globally, IoT adoption and usage is much higher in the commercial space.
- **Logistics, fleet telematics** : Logistics as a sector is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years in India. Regulatory changes such as GST implementation would drive consolidation and growth. The booming e-commerce sector is another key driver for the logistics industry.
	- With growth and consolidation, logistics companies would be looking to better leverage technology to drive efficiency in operations and this where IoT could play a key role.
	- Tata Motors as begun putting sensors into its trucks, so that fleet owners can get information on how the vehicles are used, and even predict potential breakdowns.
	- Vendor community also sees to be interested in the IoT opportunities in the logistics space.
- Cisco and L&T Technologies announced a tie-up in September 2014, to explore IoT opportunities in transportation and other infrastructure sectors.
- Smart cities and utility services : With the new government coming out with an IoT policy, and the stated plans of developing smart cities, there is significant scope for growth of IoT in multiple government and utility services.
- There are signs of some vendor activity also. Tech Mahindra has announced a tie-up with Bosch Software Innovations, to develop an ecosystem to enable innovative solutions for the connected world and connected enterprises.
- Industrial automation / supply chain / inventory management : Indian [[India and the manufacturing sector\|manufacturing sector]] has seen a significant growth in IT adoption. IoT applications for the [[India and the manufacturing sector\|manufacturing sector]] whether it is automation or supply chain management would be a key growth area in India.
- Other areas of possible growth include insurance sector, where some of the insurance companies in India have started experimenting with IoT, primarily in the automobile insurance space; and the healthcare sector which is growing very rapidly and modernizing fast.
## Challenges thrown up by the advent of IoT
- **Data Management** : Connected devices are going to produce massive amount of data. Companies need to figure out a way to store, track, analyze and make sense of the vast amounts of data that will be generated. 
- **Privacy & Security** : With billions of devices being connected together, what can people do to make sure that their information stays secure? Will someone be able to hack into your toaster and thereby get access to your entire network? The IoT also opens up companies all over the world to more security threats. Then we have the issue of privacy and data sharing.
- **Consumer IoT adoption would be slow in India** : Due to various challenges, consumer IoT adoption would be slow in India. Some of these IoT adoptions challenges (data security, lack of standardization, data ownership issues, ROI, etc.) are really not unique to India. 
- Apart from these challenges, IoT in India, especially in the consumer space, would need to reckon with a few other hurdles. These are:
	- Internet availability / bandwidth / reliability : Even today Internet connectivity is a major challenge in India. For consumer IoT adoption – this would remain a major challenge.
	- Cost of IoT enabled systems and devices : Even products such as wearable fitness bands are yet to take off in India, and price is a key reason. Indian consumers are very selective in terms of where they would invest when it comes to technology
	- Lack of vendor activity : Global vendors, often mistakenly, assume that Indian consumers are “not ready” for advanced products. This is very much evident in the IoT space, with hardly any kind of vendor activity today. This, in turn, has led to low awareness levels of IoT devices and systems among consumers.
	- Overall infrastructure challenges : Apart from the internet the supporting infrastructure such as smart grids, traffic systems, etc., are far from being ready for IoT.

## Way forward
- IoT will continue to evolve in the coming years and one can expect significant growth in the long run.
- However, reliable internet connectivity and overall supporting infrastructure will be a key prerequisite for this growth. If things fall into place, IoT has the cpotential to provide substantial benefits.

> What is meant by "Internet of Things (IoT)"? What are its potential applications? Why is it being seen as integral to the idea of smart cities? Explain.

# Near Field Communication (NFC)
- It’s a new standard of wireless communication. It enables users to transmit radio frequency wave over a very short distance just about few centimeters.  
## Advantages of NFC
- Since it’s a very short range communication, power consumption is very negligible or no power consumption.
- It can transfer low amount of data between devices enabled with NFC.
- No need of pairing the devices, its ready to use at just a click or swipe.
- Can be used as a [[Financial technology\|fintech]] solution : 
	- Tech Mahindra, the Tech & Software development arm of Mahindra Group, announced launch of **Mobo-Money**, a NFC based, contactless digital payment ecosystem. Mobo Money will be the first commercial roll-out of NFC (Near Field Communication) for an ecosystem. The company aims to get about one million merchants including local kirana shop owners on board.
## NFC vs RFID
- NFC is still an emerging technology; RFID, however, is currently in widespread use all over the world.
### Radio-frequency identification (RFID)
- RFID is for one-way conversation: an unpowered RFID tag can provide information when scanned by a powered RFID reader, typically at distances between a few centimeters (high-frequency) and a few meters (ultra high-frequency), and without the necessity of a direct line of sight.
- The tags themselves are available passive (meaning they must be powered by a separate device) or active (meaning they are powered and can transmit data). ==RFID is most commonly used in situations requiring asset tracking==.

### NFC
- A subset of RFID, NFC does share some of the same properties - i.e., one-way communication without a direct line of sight -yet there are some distinct differentiators. 
- ==NFC is actually capable of a two-way conversation (and this can be used for more complex, secure interactions)==. 
- Unlike RFID, NFC is limited to high-frequency (HF), close-proximity communication, typically up to 10 centimeters.
- Also, only one NFC tag can be scanned at a time. These factors make it the ideal choice for contactless payments. 
- The prime advantage of NFC is that most modern mobile devices are now NFC-enabled and can be used as a mobile reader device, so no extra reader infrastructure is necessary.

With reference to ‘Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology’, which of the following statements is/are correct? #pre2015

1.  It is a contactless communication technology that uses electromagnetic radio fields.
2.  NFC is designed for use by devices which can be at a distance of even a metre from each other.
3.  NFC can use encryption when sending sensitive information.

Select the correct answer using the code given below:

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
**(c) 1 and 3 only**
(d) 1, 2 and 3

</div></div>

### Optical Communication Systems
Optical communication is communication at a distance using light to carry information. It can be performed visually or by using electronic devices.

# Fiber Optics Technology

 A technology that uses glass (or plastic) threads (fibers) to transmit data. Fiber optic cables consists of a bundle of these threads to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair. We rely on them to transmit light signals over long distances.
 
## Advantages over traditional metal communication lines
 - higher bandwidths (data transfer rates) than electrical cables - means OFCs can carry more data.
 - signals travel along them with less loss.
 - fibers are immune to electromagnetic interference a problem from which metal wires suffer.
 - Much thinner and lighter than metal wires
 - Data can be transmitted digitally.
 - Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications, some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers.

## How Do Fiber Optics Work?
- Fiber optics is actually a transmission medium – a “pipe” to carry signals over long distances at very high speeds.
- Light travels down a fiber optic cable by bouncing off the walls of the cable repeatedly. Each light particle (photon) bounces down the pipe with continued internal mirror-like reflection.
- The light beam travels down the **core** of the cable. ==The core is the middle of the cable and the glass structure==. The **cladding** is another layer of glass wrapped around the core with a lower index of refraction. Cladding is there to keep the light signals inside the core.
- Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of **total internal reflection** which causes the fiber to act as a waveguide.

## Fiber optics
- The field of applied science and engineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as fiber optics. 
- The term was coined by Indian-American physicist **Narinder Singh Kapany**, who is widely acknowledged as the father of fiber optics. - He wrote a 1960 article in *Scientific American* - that introduced the topic to a wide audience, and wrote the first book about the new field.  
## Uses of Optical Fiber in Our Daily Life
Fiber optic cables are now the foundation of our communication and computer networks.
- computer networking
- broadcasting
- medical scanning
- military equipment
- uses in remote sensing.
- can be used as sensors to measure strain, temperature, pressure etc. 
- can be used to transmit power using a photovoltaic cell to convert the light into electricity. (case of use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields)
- It can be used for optical monitoring of power line health.
	- Researches in IIT Madras have demonstrated that by using 'Raman thermometry on OFCs, they can achieve monitoring of power transmission cables'. Raman thermometry is an application of **Raman effect**.

# LiDAR
>LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (distances) to a target. #definition #introduction 

- These light pulses combined with other data recorded by the airborne system, generate precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics.
- A LiDAR instrument principally **consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized GPS receiver.**  
	- Airplanes and helicopters are the most commonly used platforms for acquiring LiDAR data over broad areas.
	- LiDAR follows a simple principle - **throw laser light at an object on the earth surface and calculate the time it takes to return to the LiDAR source.** Given the speed at which the light travels (approximately 186,000 miles per second), the process of measuring the exact distance through LiDAR appears to be incredibly fast.
![lidar_operating_principles.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/lidar_operating_principles.jpg)
![Pasted image 20210317170249.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210317170249.png)
## Applications
- Land management and planning efforts, including hazard assessment, forestry, agriculture, geologic mapping, and watershed and river surveys etc.
- It is also used in **archaeology.** It can be used for identification of prehistoric sites, (recently used by UK scientists)
- Useful in [[Space pollution\|space debris]] management - Using cameras and LiDAR we can send data about the debris back to the ground for processing. - Used in Remove DEBRIS mission.
- India uses LiDAR for road construction projects, in Indian railways, agriculture etc.

## Challenges with LiDAR
- Can’t perform well in fog, rain, snow and dusty weather.
- Struggles to detect a glass wall or door, which is why smartphone manufacturers and self-driving cars makers use LiDAR along with secondary cameras and sensors.
- LiDAR can measure the distance to surrounding objects up to 5 meters away, but won’t fare well in identifying objects in the vicinity.

# Li-Fi
**Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)** is similar to Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) but **uses light for data transmission instead of radio waves.** It facilitates the wireless method of data transmission through **Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology** and can be up to 100 times faster than Wi-Fi. It **uses solid-state lighting (SSL) such as LED bulbs.** 

Visible Light Spectrum: Li-Fi uses visible light. This indicates that **Li-Fi has a wider range of available frequencies** as the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than the entire radio spectrum. It covers frequencies **from 430,000 to 770,000 GHz** and colours from **near-ultraviolet to near-infrared.**

**Professor Harald Haas** is considered to be the founder of this technology. In September 2013, his company released the world's first commercially available Li-Fi technology. 
==Li-Fi market was valued at USD 143 million in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 3.52 billion by the year 2025.==
## Applications of Li-Fi
- **Airlines** - as it will not interfere with the equipment on the aircraft that relies on radio waves such as its radar.
- **undersea explorations** - as light can travel through water.
- **operation theatres**- in the hospitals as light waves have little effect on medical instruments. 
- It can be used in offices and homes for data transmission and internet browsing. 

## Pros of Li-Fi 
- **Speed** : Light spectrum is nearly 10,000 times larger than the spectrum occupied by radio waves thereby carrying more information 100 times faster than Wi-Fi. It can transmit data at a rate of 224 GB per second. 
- **Efficient and Cheaper** : Li-Fi is more efficient and cheaper than Wi-Fi due to the nature of LED bulbs. It will save costs in homes and workplaces as it can work without electronic devices such as routers, modems, and so forth. 
- **Security**: Radio waves can be intercepted by people outside your network as they can pass through walls, compromising the security of your data. However, light can be stopped by opaque objects, making Li-Fi more secure than Wi-Fi. Additionally, some rooms can be designated as high-security areas with their own Li-Fi networks. 
- **Availability**: With Li-Fi, every light source can facilitate you with the internet. Once the technology is available to the general public, it can be accessed via street lights, building lights, and so forth.
- It has **less interference.**
- Li-Fi **can pass through salty seawater** 
- It can **work in the dense region.**
## Cons of Li-Fi
- **Limited Range**: As light cannot penetrate through walls, it is good with the security point of view but it provides a limited range. Thus, Li-Fi can be effectively used in closed spaces(up to 10m). In open spaces, Wi-Fi's coverage can go up to 32 meters as compared to Li-Fi. 
- **Limited Compatibility**: As technology is new, not many devices are compatible with it. 

## Significance of Li-Fi technology
- Year-over-Year, consumption of wireless data is increasing by 60%. This means that the radio-frequency space is becoming saturated and may lead to **spectrum crunch** (*lack of sufficient wireless frequency to support increasing consumers*) negatively impacting the speed of internet usage.
- Li-Fi can be applied in traffic control systems using a car’s headlights or in chemical manufacturing plants where radio frequency is too dangerous.
- With Li-Fi, the **spectrum can be utilized more than 1000 times greater than the entire spectrum** used for radio frequencies. 
- It provides more access points in comparison to Wi-Fi.

Thus, there's a need for Li-Fi as Wi-Fi won't be able to keep up with the increased demand for data and can be used in places where radio waves cannot reach.


As Li-Fi **can work without devices such as routers, modems, signal repeaters, wave ampLiFiers and antennas,** it would not incur an extra cost. 

At present, Li-Fi cannot fully replace Wi-Fi as a connectivity source. However, with the increased consumer base and demand of fast internet access, it is predicted that the **Li-Fi would be released to the general public in early 2022** and **future homes and building may be housed with Li-Fi.**

# Free-space optical communication (FSO)
- Free-space optics (FSO) systems are employed for 'last mile' telecommunications and can function over distances of several kilometres as long as there is a *clear line of sight between the source and the destination*, and the optical receiver can reliably decode the transmitted information.
- Free-space systems can provide high-data-rate, long-range links using small, low-mass, low-power-consumption subsystems which make them suitable for communications in space.
- Various planned satellite constellations intended to provide global broadband coverage take advantage of these benefits and employ laser communication for inter-satellite links between the several hundred to thousand satellites effectively creating a space-based optical mesh network. e.g. [[Starlink Network\|Starlink Network]].
- More generally, transmission of unguided optical signals is known as optical wireless communications (OWC). Examples include medium-range visible light communication and short-distance IrDA, using infrared LEDs. 


- **Google’s X FSOC or Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC)** has enabled the remote tribal villages located in the hills of East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh to get connected with the outside world.
- It provides services like mobile connectivity, internet, and wireless landline connectivity to the villages.
- The initiative has made facilities like **[[tele-medicine\|tele-medicine]], public grievances redressal, online education** etc. accessible for remote villages.
- Availability of connectivity will help to eradicate [[Left Wing Extremism (LWE)\|Left Wing Extremism (LWE)]]

# Big data
>Big data is a buzzword used to describe a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is too large to process using traditional software techniques. Big data is big in terms of volume, velocity and variety. veracity (4Vs of Big data) #definition #introduction 
## Uses of big data
1. [[NITI Aayog\|NITI Aayog]] also echoed the idea of evidence based policy making guided by Big data.
2. Big data is used to better understand customers and their behaviours and preferences. This will also increase the customer loyalty.
3. The computing power of big data analytics enables us to decode entire DNA strings in minutes and will allow us to find new cures and better understand and predict disease patterns. 4. Weather forecasting can be made more robust now, which can lead to better agricultural growth.
5. Financial data analysing for banks, stock market, customised service for special customers.
6. Analysing and managing the NATGRID data which comes from 21 sources. This can help us in better intelligence. Big data also helps us in fighting crimes and terrorism.
7. Discoms in India are using data from last mile sensors to implement measures of cutting down aggregated technical and commercial losses.
8. Big Data is used to improve our homes, cities and countries by optimizing the heating or lighting in our homes, the traffic flow in our cities, or the energy grid across the country.
9. It can help in curbing trafficking in human beings. Increasingly, traffickers make use of mobile phones, social media, online classifieds and other internet platforms. Data from these technologies could be collected and used to identify, track, and prosecute traffickers.
10. Police forces and security agencies use big data to prevent cyber-attacks, detect credit card fraud, foil terrorism and even predict criminal activity
11. Big Data is used in healthcare to find new cures for cancer, to optimize treatment and even predict diseases before any physical symptoms appear.
12. Big Data is used to analyze and improve the performance of individuals (at sports, at home or work) where data from sensors in equipment and wearable devices can be combined with video analytics to get insights that traditionally were impossible to see.
### Application in agriculture and food processing
- Seed Selection: Big-data businesses can analyse varieties of seeds across numerous fields, soil types, and climates and select the best.
- Crop disease: Similar to the way in which Google can identify flu outbreaks based on where web searches are originating, analysing crops across farms helps identify diseases that could ruin a potential harvest.
- Irrigation: Precision agriculture aids farmers in tailored and effective water management, helping in production, improving economic efficiency and minimising.
- Waste and environmental impact.
- Weather: Advanced analytics capabilities and agri-robotics such as aerial imagery, sensors help provide sophisticated local weather forecasts can help increasing global agricultural productivity over the next few decades.
- Food processing: They help in streamlining food processing value chains by finding the core determinants of process performance, and taking action to continually improve the accuracy, quality and yield of production. They also optimise production schedules based on supplier, customer, machine availability and cost constraints.
- Loss control: In India, every year 21 million tons of wheat is lost, primarily due to scare cold-storage centres and refrigerated vehicles, poor transportation facilities and unreliable electricity supply. Big Data has the potential of systematisation of demand forecasting thus reducing such losses.
- Pricing – A trading platform for agricultural commodities that links small-scale producers to retailers and bulk purchasers via mobile phone messaging can help send up-to-date market prices via an app or SMS and connect farmers with buyers, offering collective bargaining opportunities for small and marginal farmers.
### Use of Big data in tackling [[Climate Change\|climate change]]
Since, climate change and extreme weather events will demand proactive measures to adapt or develop resiliency, Big Data can bring in the right information to take informed decisions.
## Dangers posed by big data
1. Data colonialism: Most of the data from developing countries goes to servers located in the west. This is because of absence of adequate regulations dealing with privacy. Thus western companies continue to collect and use this data with impunity.
2. Cyber crime: Big data allows fraudsters to collect huge amounts of data which can include credit card numbers and online banking passwords.
3. Privacy: NSA’s PRISM program of the United States has put the potential dangers of Big Data analytics. It can snoop on almost every user in cyberspace. Anonymization of data or invasion of privacy and Data security. Lack of proper virtual safety raise grave concerns as most of Data today is generated online.
4. Unreliable: Data collected is often unreliable and thus basing decisions solely on that is risky. Inefficient infrastructure for data collection and management is the main reason.
5. Companies may target customers by bringing together data from their own transactions as well as social media data
6. Data sharing: Data sharing is not prominent today thus benefitting the status quoits.
7. Inefficient infrastructure (data management centers) for data collection and management
8. Constant evaluation of feedbacks generated from new data required: To use Big Data effectively for policymaking, the government must adopt a dynamic approach and be willing to be flexible regarding its policy structure and processes.
## Measures to be taken
1. Make laws on privacy to address citizen’s concerns regarding privacy.
2. We shouldn’t rely solely on actionable information derived from big data but a humane touch in decision making is required as well.
3. Data pools should be maintained which should be in common domain to enhance transparency, access and equity.
4. Source of data should be verified before using it to identify actionable points.
5. In order to effectively analyze the large chunks of data available, the government must establish well-equipped data centres. It is essential to segregate the relevant data from the irrelevant.
6. It must strengthen its [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]] in order to make the large pool of data available virtually safe.
7. It must also address the ethical issues regarding big data analytics.

Big data is here to stay and it is up to us on how to utilise it in the most efficient way possible. If handled properly it has the ability to impact our lives in a positive way both socially and economically.

# Blockchain Technology
>It is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions on thousands of computers globally in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retrospectively. #definition #introduction 

- It is a secured way of conducting online transactions and its use, removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset.

## How Blockchain works
![Pasted image 20201022145212.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020201022145212.png)

## Advantages
- Each block comprises of a hash pointer that acts as a link to a previous block. Along with those it comprises of a timestamp and transaction data.
- Blockchains are resistant technologies to modification of the data.
- No counterfeit: cyber fraud can be prevented as all transactions can be verified.
- cost benefit: eases the cost and complexity involved in transactions.(reduces the cost of sending remittances)
	- In the case of cross-border remittances, its use enables instant transfer of money as against the current system that takes about a week for the same.

![Pasted image 20210302174106.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210302174106.png)
## Applications of Blockchain technology
- [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrency]]: It is the technology behind cryptocurrencies, for example, Bitcoins.
- Governance: 
	- check corruption. increases transparency and efficiency.
	- digitisation of land records.
	- efficient record keeping
	- voting
- Healthcare : 
- Education : certificates can be stored online. easy verification
- Financial Services :
	- faster settlements
	- can be used anti-money laundering
	- greater transparency
	- no intermediaries
	- [[Financial technology\|FinTech]]

## Challenges
- Tax evasion
- criminal activities like terror funding, drug trade
- no regulator for settlement of disputes
- vulnerable to hacking, DDoS attacks.

## Non Fungible Token (NFT) asset
>NFTs are digital assets that cryptographically represent the ownership of real items like art, music, collectibles and even real estate. They are modern collectibles that can be bought and sold online like any property, mainly using cryptocurrencies, but with no tangible form of their own. NFTs exist on a blockchain, the database that underpins cryptocurrencies.
- **Non-Fungible Assets:** are not interchangeable. Each one has its unique properties and worth and is never equal in value or similar to another.   For NFTs, for example, the value of each token is defined by its unique properties.

### **Characteristics of The Non-Fungible Token (NFT)**
- **Scarcity:** NFTs derive their value from being scarce and unique. Every NFT is special with an unalterable record making it authentic and unequaled.
- **Transparency:** Non-fungible tokens are stored on a distributed ledger, a decentralized and secured database where records of token issuance, transfers and activities can be publicly verified. 
- **Interoperability and Indivisibility:** NFTs can be sold and purchased across distributed ledgers. They are indivisible and can’t be utilized partially. 
- **Ownership:** The ownership of NFTs is managed through unique ID and metadata, neither can be replicated. An NFT can only have one owner at a time. Smart contracts assign ownership of NFTs and manage their transferability.

# Financial technology
Fintech is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services. The key segments within the FinTech space include Digital Payments, Digital Lending, BankTech, InsurTech and [[Financial technology#RegTech\|RegTech]], [[Financial technology#SupTech\|SupTech]], [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrency]]. 

Recently, India has overtaken China as Asia’s top financial technology FinTech market. Having emerged as the world’s second-largest fin-tech hub (trailing only the US), India is experiencing the ‘FinTech Boom’.
- Indian fintech valuation may reach $160 billion by - (3 times of present value)
- India has more than 2100 fintech companies, out of which two thirds have been set up over last 5 years.

FinTech now includes different sectors and industries such as education, retail banking, fundraising and nonprofit, and investment management to name a few. FinTech is amongst the most thriving sectors at present in terms of both business growth and employment generation. Apart from this, FinTech can also help in the furtherance of the goal of [[Financial Inclusion\|financial inclusion]].

## Active Areas of FinTech Innovation
- Cryptocurrency and digital cash.
- [[Blockchain Technology\|Blockchain technology]], that maintains records on a network of computers, but has no central ledger.
- Smart contracts, which utilize computer programs (often utilizing the blockchain) to automatically execute contracts between buyers and sellers.
- Open banking, a concept that leans on the blockchain and posits that third-parties should have access to bank data to build applications that create a connected network of financial institutions and third-party providers.
- Insurtech, which seeks to use technology to simplify and streamline the insurance industry.
- Regtech, which seeks to help financial service firms meet industry compliance rules, especially those covering Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer protocols which fight fraud.
- [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]], given the proliferation of cybercrime and the decentralized storage of data, [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]] and fintech are intertwined.

### RegTech
- It is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry **through technology**.
- The main functions of Regtech include regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance.
- RegTech uses [[Cloud computing\|cloud computing]] technology through software-as-a-service (SaaS) to help businesses comply with regulations efficiently and less expensively.
- The rise in digital products has increased data breaches, cyber hacks, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities.

### SupTech
- It helps supervisory agencies to digitize reporting and regulatory processes, resulting in more efficient and proactive monitoring of risk and compliance at financial institutions.
- Suptech is currently found in two areas of applications: **data collection and data analytics**.

## Key Growth Drivers of FinTech in India
>“At 87%, India has the highest FinTech adoption rate in the world against the global average of 64%”
- Widespread identity formalisation (Aadhar: 1.2 bn enrolments)
- High level of banking penetration through the Jan Dhan Yojana: 1+ bn bank accounts.
- High smartphone penetration: 1.2 bn mobile subscribers.
- India Stack: Set of APIs for businesses and startups.
- Growing disposable income of Indians.
- Key government initiatives such as UPI and [[Digital India\|Digital India]].
- Wide middle-class expansion: By 2030, India will add 140 mn middle-income and 21 mn high-income households which will drive the demand and growth in the Indian FinTech space.
- India’s fintech industry came to rescue of people during the lockdown and 2nd wave of Covid, promoting contactless banking
## Opportunities Related to FinTech
- Driving Financial Inclusion in India: A significant number of people in India remain outside the purview of the formal financial system.
	- Use of financial technologies can help address the gaps in financial inclusion left by the traditional models of banking and finance.
- Providing Financial Assistance to the MSMEs : Lack of capital is one of the biggest threats to their existence. According to the IFC Report, the total addressable credit gap in the MSME segment is estimated to USD 397.5 billion.
	- This is where FinTech comes into the picture, and has the potential to solve the credit availability issues.
	- With several FinTech start-ups offering easier and quicker access to loans, MSMEs are no longer required to go through the tedious process of documentation, paperwork and multiple visits to a bank.
- Enhancing Customer Experience and Transparency: FinTech start-ups offer convenience, personalisation, transparency, accessibility and ease of use – factors that empower customers to a great extent.
	- The FinTech industry will develop unique and innovative models for assessing risks.
	- Leveraging [[Big data\|big data]], [[Machine learning\|machine learning]], and alternative data to underwrite credit and develop credit scores for customers with a limited credit history will improve the penetration of financial services in India.
## Future of fintech in India
- Blockchains
- Alternate lending
- Robo advisory
- Digital payments
- Insurance sector
## Associated Challenges
- **Cyber-Attacks:** Automation of processes and digitization of data makes fintech systems vulnerable to attacks from hackers.
	- Recent instances of hacks at debit card companies and banks are illustrations of the ease with which hackers can gain access to systems and cause irreparable damage.
- **Data Privacy Issue:** The most important questions for consumers pertain to the responsibility for cyber attacks as well as misuse of personal information and important financial data.
- **Difficulty in Regulation:** Regulation is also a problem in the emerging world of FinTech, especially cryptocurrencies.
	- In most countries, they are unregulated and have become fertile ground for scams and frauds.
	
Due to the diversity of offerings in FinTech, it is difficult to formulate a single and comprehensive approach to these problems.
### Hurdles for India's FinTech industry
![Pasted image 20210324172903.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210324172903.png)
## Way Forward
- **Guarding Against Cybercriminals:** Currently, India majorly relies on import of offensive as well as defensive [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]] capabilities. Given the growing scale of adoption of technology, it is imperative for India to attain Atma-Nirbharta (Self-Sufficiency) in this domain.
- **Educating Consumers:** Apart from establishing technological safeguards, educating and training customers to spread awareness about the benefits of fintech and guard against cyberattacks will also help in democratisation of FinTech.
- **Data Protection Law:** Established fintech sandboxes by RBI to evaluate the implications of technology in the sector is a step in the right direction.
	- The passing of General Data Protection Regulation, a framework for collecting and using personal data, in the EU is a great attempt to limit the amount of personal data available to banks.
	- However, there is a requirement for a strong data protection framework in India.
	- In this context, the personal data protection bill, 2019, must be passed after thorough debate and deliberation.

## Conclusion
Fintech has the potential to transform other financial services like insurance, investment, remittances. However, regulation must help, not hinder its evolution.

# Virtual Reality
Virtual Reality can be used as an umbrella term to describe other technologies similar to, but different from, an actual reality experience. e.g. Facebook’s Oculus equipped with the technology.
## Virtual Reality (VR)
- VR is the most widely known of these technologies. It is fully immersive, which tricks our senses into thinking we are in a different environment or world apart from the real world. 
- Using a headmounted display (HMD) or headset, we experience a computer-generated world of imagery and sounds in which we can manipulate objects and move around using haptic controllers while tethered to a console or PC.
## Augmented Reality (AR)
- ==AR overlay digital information on real-world elements.== 'Pokemon GO' is among the best-known examples. 
- Augmented reality keeps the real world central but enhances it with other digital details, layering new strata of perception and supplementing your reality or environment. 
- Current variations of AR use our phone or tablet’s camera to detect the real world and overlay 3D objects over it. The most common is the tech used in social apps like Snapchat, that change our face using masks that orient themselves and animate based on the movement of our facial features and muscles.
## Mixed Reality (MR)
- MR brings together real world and digital elements. In mixed reality, we interact with and manipulate both physical and virtual items and environments, using next-generation sensing and imaging technologies. 
- It allows us to see and immerse ourself in the world around us even as we interact with a virtual environment using our own hands-all without ever removing our headset. It provides the ability to have one foot (or hand) in the real world and the other in an imaginary place, breaking down basic concepts between real and imaginary, offering an experience that can change the way we play game and work today.
## Applications of VR
applications of VR are not limited to just gaming. We are using this technology in the field of military, healthcare, education, fashion, business, sports, media, engineering, entertainment, scientific visualization, architecture, among others. 
### Education
- Education sector has adopted VR for teaching and learning situations. It has the potential to revolutionise learning, retention and content delivery exponentially.
- One can learn to play musical instruments, fix a computer, and draw a painting in the virtual world. VR-enabled classrooms allow real-time assessment of students with different capacities. There will always be students with different rates of lesson absorption, retention and ability for application. 
- VR can change the way education is served in remote areas. A universal classroom can become a reality. Students can become a part of global education systems and instantly access latest breakthroughs in knowledge, practice and technology.
- Augmented reality will allow teachers, trainers, facilitators and institutions the option to insert the digitally rendered VR elements and graphics into the real world to help students attain learning goals more efficiently. (e.g. Online teaching in Kerala during Lockdown period)

### Engineering and Architecture
- Virtual reality plays a major role in simulating 3-dimensional models or designs of infrastructures, which can provide a real-life experience of the physical designs of infrastructures beforehand. This is reducing considerable costs and expenses which can be incurred in a prototype. 
- With the help of VR, cars, machines, aeroplanes etc. can be virtually designed and pretested for factors.

### Healthcare
- medical students can be trained in AR environments.
- [[tele-medicine\|Tele Medicine]] options that enable medical professionals to interact with patients. 
- In critical situations, augmented reality applications can deliver realtime information to the treatment area to support diagnosis, surgery and treatment plans. 
- AccuVein is a handheld device that can scan the vein network of a patient that leads to a 45% reduction in escalations. 
### Military
- It has been adopted by all the three military services – air force, navy and army. VR is being put to different uses in the military. It is used to train soldiers in a simulated battlefield. This gives soldiers the opportunity to learn without the risk of being killed or injured.
- They can simulate many kinds of battle field scenarios. All the scenarios include flight simulation, medical administration in the battlefield, virtual boot camps and several other scenarios. 
- Virtual reality can also be used to treat post-traumatic stress. The triggers of the crisis will be simulated for the purpose of the treatment. When the patients are exposed to the triggers often, they will gradually get over the trauma.
### Cinemas
- Viewers will be engaged and fully immersed in the movie. In fact, they will feel like they are a part of the movie. This is why movies are six times as interesting when viewed through VR head mounted display units. And horror movies are twenty times more real and scarier when watched on virtual reality platform.
## Issues and Challenges
### Social Impact
- The users who are engage in violence VR video games and television in the virtual world may become desensitized to their violent virtual actions and mimic that behavior in real world. 
- There are other issues like people turning their backs on the real world and wander around the synthetic worlds that fulfill their whims. As of now, violence in VR is nearly inevitable but it is still important to address social issues before they result in crisis or harm.
### Health and Safety Issues
Ensuring health and safety of users are important. Developers should ensure that advancement in technology do not come at the expense of human well-being. When experiencing VR, the brain tends to work harder to integrate the unusual stimuli being presented to the different senses. Therefore, VR has power to affect the senses and brain of a user, leading to fatigue or sickness such as dizziness and nausea unlike any other simpler media. It is due to the problems in hardware, lowlevel software or carelessness of a VR developer who disregards the side effects of the experience on the user. Prolonged repetitive VR movements can lead to fatigue as the interference requires large amounts of muscular effort. VR users have high chances of affecting their tissues.
### Cyber Sickness
- Cyber sickness is a form of motion sickness that occurs as a result of exposure to VR. It can range from slight headache to an emetic response. Several factors has been identified that may contribute to cyber sickness such as vection, lag, field of view but it is still an undergoing research to identify the specific causes of cyber sickness and to develop methods to alleviate this ailment. Vection is illusion of self movement in VR which causes conflicts between the visual and vestibular system in the body because the motion is just illusion. Other indirect consequences of VR exposure are as head spinning, postural ataxia, reduced eye-hand coordination, vestibular disturbances and etc.
### Real World Applications
After spending too much time in a virtual environment, it may be difficult for users to return to the real world and behave the same way they did before the virtual experience. They may be desensitized to certain types of violence or interactions, which could damage their social relationships. They may also overestimate their physical abilities, attempting a jump they cannot make or trying a skill they have only perfected in a VR environment.
### User Privacy
 Users will be able to take more actions and interact with more types of content than ever before, engaging in behaviors they may avoid in the real world. Who is responsible for ensuring users’ privacy, and how could this data be used? Should it be allowed to be given to advertisers, or remain in the individual’s control.
 ## Way Forward
Virtual reality is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there. It uses a host of technologies to achieve this goal and is a technically complex feat that has to account for our perception and cognition. It has both entertainment and serious uses. The technology is becoming cheaper and more widespread. We can expect to see many more innovative uses for the technology in the future and perhaps a fundamental way in which we communicate and work.

# Data Privacy
Data privacy is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, and the legal and political issues surrounding them. It is also known as Information privacy or data protection.

As more of our data becomes digitized, and we share more information online, data privacy is taking on greater importance.

## Why is data privacy important?
- A data breach at a government agency can, for example, put top secret information in the hands of an enemy state. Also the data protection provisions under [[Information Technology Act, 2000\|IT Act]] do not apply to government agencies.
- A breach at a corporation can put proprietary data in the hands of a competitor. (recent data breach at MobiKwik)
- A breach at a school could put students’ PII (personally identifiable information) in the hands of criminals who could commit identity theft. 
- A breach at a hospital or doctor’s office can put PHI in the hands of those who might misuse it.
- [[Monopoly of Big Tech companies\|Monopoly of Big Tech companies]] further compound the concerns.
- **The Puttaswamy judgement** holds that the [[Right to privacy\|Right to privacy]] is protected as a fundamental constitutional right under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India.
- Pandemic has forced more people to participate in the digital economy.
- Data protection laws would **improve business processes,** and their compliance will eventually lead to securing digital payments, and improvement in banking operations as well.

## Steps taken to ensure user privacy
**BN Srikrishna Committee (2017)** report highlighted the need to have a Technology agnostic law- data protection law must be flexible to include changing technologies. It recommended to include:
	
 - Informed and meaningful consent
 - Bill seeks to apply data protection regime to both government and private entities across all sectors.
 - Minimal and necessary data processing.
 - Data controller must be accountable for any processing.
 - Establishing a high-powered statutory authority for enforcement, supported by a decentralised enforcement mechanism.
 - Penalties for wrongful data processing.
 - Bill seeks to create and Independent Data Protection Authority (DPA).

### Draft Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act (DISHA), 2018
- It seeks to ensure the protection of data related to physical, physiological and mental health condition, sexual orientation, medical records and history and Biometric information.

## Challenges with data protection in India
1.  Data centers of the major tech giants are situated outside India and hence outside the ambit of Indian jurisdiction.
2.  India lacks a dedicated institutional and legislative infrastructure to tackle such issues.
3.  Surveillance by Police also causes a concentration of power and puts civil liberties at serious risk. - The Indian Telegraph Act, 18885 states that government can intercept a "message or class of messages " - The proposed data protection legislation fails to consider surveillance.
4.  **unauthorized leaks,** hacking, cyber crimes, and frauds. Monetary cost of data loss/theft is very high. e.g. there are numerous cases of Aadhaar data leaks by government websites themselves due to technical glitch.

## Steps mus be taken
1.  It is time for technology companies like Facebook to take the onus of creating awareness about data protection upon themselves.
2.  While regulators in the US, China and the EU have put in place laws to address concerns around privacy and data protection, India has so far taken a piecemeal approach.
3.  Consumers on their part should be wary of sharing information online. Even harmless looking mobile applications are able to collect large amounts of data.
4.  Government should ask these tech giants to set up their data centres in India.
5.  The principles laid down by **Justice BN Srikrishna committee** are forward looking and there is a need to frame a comprehensive legislation mandating collector responsibility and also specifying penal provisions in case of data breaches.
6.  This becomes all the way necessary when privacy has been declared one of the fundamental right.
## Way forward
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules** framed by the EU has become a model for the world when it comes to privacy. Right to be forgotten is also in effect in the EU.
- There is an urgent need to pass the draft personal data protection bill, 2019 which seeks to regulate the processing of personal data of individuals (data principals) by government and private entities (data fiduciaries) incorporated in India and abroad.

>India does not have a legal architecture to deal with data theft and compromise issues. Do you agree? What are the challenges regarding data protection and how can they be addressed?

# Data localisation

Data localisation is a concept that the personal data of a country’s residents should be processed and stored in that country.

It may restrict flow entirely or allow for conditional data sharing or data mirroring. In 2018, a draft data protection law by **BN Shri Krishna Committee** also recommended that all personal data of Indians have at least one copy in India. It also defined a category of data as critical personal data, which must be stored and processed only in India.

RBI issued a directive advising all Payment System Operators (PSOs) to ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems is stored within databases located in India.

## Need for data localisation
1. Economic development of the country. Data is the new oil, an economic resource, fueling the 4th [[INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\|Industrial Revolution]]. Domains of [[Cloud computing\|cloud computing]], data analytics etc., can become major job creators in future.
2. Localisation would lead to a larger presence of MNC’s in India overall, through local offices, and increase tax liability and open more jobs.
3. With data localisation, there is a scope of greater access to ‘public data’ collected by companies (e.g. traffic data collected by like Uber, street level data collected by Google Maps) for the Government.
4. Maintain **data sovereignty** and citizens data privacy. With data stored in remote servers, the accountability of service providers (like Google, Facebook etc.) reduces as it is outside the purview of Indian regulatory authorities. With data localisation, regulatory oversight on end-use of data will improve.
5. Issue of national security. Data localisation will help law enforcement agencies to get access to user data for investigation and prosecution.
## Challenges associated with localisation
1. Economic Costs: Cross-border data flows have contributed $2.8 trillion to the global economy in 2014, set to increase to $11 trillion by 2025. Stringent localisation norms could affect innovation & [[Ease of doing business\|ease of doing business]] in India.
2. Security Concerns: Isolating payment systems from global data network would reduce their operational efficiency and make transactions prone to frauds, systemic risks or a single point of failure.
3. Push to protectionism in global trade: It hampers a globalized, competitive internet marketplace. It might trigger a vicious cycle of data localisation requirements by other countries.
4. Privacy concerns: There is no evidence that data localisation leads to better privacy or security. Threat of state surveillance and misuse of personal data of citizens by the Government will remain.
5. Cloud Computing Softwares: Cloud computing softwares have taken advantage of the economies of scale and an infrastructural architecture across the world.

Data politics is not new. Before universalizing the policy of data localisation, the Government needs to provide a push to local capabilities in data storage and processing India should put in place in a [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|cybersecurity]] law to ensure protection of private data of citizens.

India walked out of Osaka track declaration in 2019

- Child Pornography
- Lack of access to internet services - 40% of mobile phone users have no internet. About 50% of the population is digitally excluded as of October 2020.
- Internet shutdowns: The past four years have seen more than 400 shutdowns. It will freeze economic activities and cause large scale disruptions in economic output. India is estimated to have lost over 20,000 crore in 2020 due to internet shutdowns. - [[Monopoly of Big Tech companies\|Monopoly of Big Tech Companies]]
- Rapid spread of fake news and misinformation - Infodemic. When there’s no information, bad information finds a way.
- disruptive technologies often change the social fabric.
- Surveillance - e.g. Pegasus spyware

# Information Technology Act, 2000
The Information Technology Act, 2000 also Known as an **IT Act** is the most important law in India *dealing with Cybercrime and E-Commerce*. IT Act is based on the **United Nations Model law on Electronic Commerce 1996 (UNCITRAL Model)** which was suggested by the General Assembly of [[United Nations Organisation (UNO)\|UN]].

The main objective of this act is to carry lawful and trustworthy electronic, digital and online transactions and alleviate or reduce cybercrimes.

**The IT Act, 2000 has two schedules:**
- **First Schedule –** Deals with documents to which the Act shall not apply.
- **Second Schedule –** Deals with electronic signature or electronic authentication method.
## The offences and the punishments in IT Act 2000
1.  Tampering with the computer source documents.
2.  Directions of Controller to a subscriber to extend facilities to decrypt information.
3.  Publishing of information which is obscene in electronic form.
4.  ==Penalty for breach of confidentiality and privacy.==
5.  ==Hacking for malicious purposes.==
6.  Penalty for publishing Digital Signature Certificate false in certain particulars.
7.  Penalty for misrepresentation.

- In 2015 [[Supreme Court\|Supreme Court]] delivered a  judgement striking down Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 in response to a PIL filed by Shreya Singhal that challenged the constitutionality of this provision.
	- The Act was amended in 2009 to insert Section 66A which was said to address cases of cyber crime with the advent of technology and the internet.
	- Section 66(A) of the Act criminalises the sending of offensive messages through a computer or other communication devices.
	- The provision continues to be invoked in cases across the country even today.
- **Section 69A**: This section grants the government power to issue directions to intermediaries to block any content that it considers prejudicial to, among other things, the sovereignty and integrity of India, national security or public order.
	- In 2009 government has also issued Blocking Rules which set up procedure for blocking.
	- SC did uphold the constitutionality of the section in **Shreya Singhal v Union of India** case 2015.
	- Twitter is an example of Intermediary. Its defiance indicates the increasing power and impunity of Big Tech.

## IT(Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021
These new rules broadly deal with the regulation of social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms and digital news.
### Major provisions
- Based on the number of users, on the social media platform intermediaries have been divided in two groups:  
	- **Social media intermediaries.**
	- **Significant social media intermediaries.**
- Significant social media intermediaries providing services primarily in the nature of messaging shall **enable identification of the first originator of the information.**
- The new rules call OTT platforms ‘publishers of online curated content’.  	- They would have to self-classify the content into five categories based on age. U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+, A (Adult). 	- OTT platforms would be required to provide parental lock systems for content classified U/A 13+ or higher, and have age verification mechanism for content classified as ‘Adult’. - Provide for a **mandatory** three layered grievance redressal mechanism.
	- **Grievance Redressal Mechanism:**  
    -   A three-level grievance redressal mechanism has been established under the rules with different levels of self-regulation.  
        - **Level-I:** Self-regulation by the publishers;
        - **Level-II:** Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers;
        - **Level-III:** Oversight mechanism.
				- **Self-regulation by the Publisher:**  
					-   Publisher shall appoint a **Grievance Redressal Officer** based in India who shall be responsible for the redressal of grievances received by it.
					-   The officer shall take decision on every grievance received by **it within 15 days.**
				- **Self-Regulatory Body:**  
					-   There may be one or more self-regulatory bodies of publishers.
					-   Such a body shall be headed by a retired judge of the SC, a High Court or independent eminent person and have not more than six members.
					-   Such a body will have to register with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
					-   This body will **oversee the adherence by the publisher to the Code of Ethics and address grievances** that have not been resolved by the publisher within 15 days.
				- **Oversight Mechanism:**  
					-   **Ministry of Information and Broadcasting** shall formulate an oversight mechanism.
					-   It shall publish a charter for self-regulating bodies, including Codes of Practices. It shall establish an Inter-Departmental Committee for hearing grievances.
### Need for Digital Media Regulation
- For ensuring Compliance to Domestic Laws : The rules stress the point that online content publishers and social media intermediaries should follow the Constitution of the country and subject themselves to domestic laws.
- For Setting Accountability : It extends its approach to instill a sense of accountability against misuse and abuse by social media users and is the first of its kind to bring social media use under the regulatory framework of the Information Technology Act.
- To bring uniformity : With these rules, India joins other international regimes that have provisions for digital media regulation and provides a comprehensive mechanism for the protection of digital media consumers.
- As a Social Imperative : It lays a special emphasis on the protection of women against the progression of sexual offenses on social media. It also envisages checking the proliferation of fake news and [[Hate speech\|hate speech]].
### Issues with new IT rules, 2021
Critics pointed that the question of stricter regulation of digital media will lead to restriction of free speech and undermining of democracy.
- Compliance burden on companies poses a financial threat, to financially strained companies which are depended on digital platforms.
- Distortion of the Idea of Self-regulation - This would be self-regulation by the media organization and the industry at the government’s pleasure.
- example of a censorship mindset that is growing around us.
- Potential misuse : any criticism of the ruling party or government could trigger an orchestrated avalanche of grievances.
- Eroding Pillars of Democracy : fourth estate or the fourth pillar , is as much a player as the other three pillars - the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/STATE/EXECUTIVE FOC\|EXECUTIVE FOC]], the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/STATE/LEGISLATURE FOC\|LEGISLATURE FOC]] and the [[GS 2/INDIAN POLITY/STATE/JUDICIARY FOC\|JUDICIARY FOC]] - in the [[Separation of power\|Separation of power]] scheme of our constitutional [[democracy\|democracy]].
- Problems in **Tracking the First Originator** : Provision for tracking messages seems challenging as the messages of Whatsapp and signal are encrypted end-to-end.
	- Tracking the first originator would entail storing sensitive information or breaking end-to-end encryption protocol, moves that could weaken overall security. Here, the users’ [[Right to privacy\|Right to privacy]] could be potentially violated. The issue gets even more complicated if the message originator is outside India.
- Twitter is violating and remaining non-committal with new IT rules
### Way Forward
- A comprehensive rules and guidelines should be made after deliberating with various stakeholders.
- regulation must be implemented through legislation that is debated in Parliament instead of relying upon executive rule-making powers under Section 69A of the IT Act.
- Urgent need for passing the the **personal data protection bill, 2019**.

# AWARENESS IN THE FIELD OF NANOTECHNOLOGY
> Nano-science is the study of materials which are in nanoscale range (1-100 nanometers). Conversion of any material in nanoscale results in alteration of its physico-chemical, biological, mechanical, optical, electronic, etc. properties which can be utilized for creating improved materials, devices and systems. #definition #introduction 

![1024px-Comparison_of_nanomaterials_sizes.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/1024px-Comparison_of_nanomaterials_sizes.jpg)
The concept behind this principle originated in a talk entitled, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” by physicist **Richard Feynman** in 1959. The term nanotechnology was actually coined by Professor **Norio Taniguchi**.

## Applications of Nanotechnology
### Medical field
- Disease diagnosis (detect cancer, bacterial and viral infection), Superbugs and anti-microbial resistance (Nanotechnology holds the key to stopping antibiotic resistant bacteria and the deadly infections they cause). Nano-pharmaceuticals for effective and targeted delivery of drugs.
#### Nano-pharmaceuticals
> Nano-pharmaceutical is an emerging field that combines nanotechnology with pharmaceutical and biomedical science with the goal of targeted drug delivery which may improve efficacy and safety profile.
##### Benefits of Nano-Pharmaceuticals
1. Precision targeting via nano-pharmaceuticals reduces toxic systemic side effects, resulting in better patient compliance.
3. They offer the ability to detect diseases at much earlier stages.
4. Nano pharmaceutical reduces the cost of drug discovery, design and development and enhances the drug delivery process.
- e.g. A team of scientists has recently created a **nanomicelle** that can be used for **effective drug delivery to treat various cancers including breast, colon and lung cancer.** Its advantages includes : Low toxicity, ability to minimize drug degradation, ability to permeate tissues easily for drug delivery, and lower adverse drug side effects.
#### Other health applications of Nanotechnology
- **Tissue Engineering**: Tissue engineering is the new emerging field of science which makes use of nanotechnology to repair the damaged tissues. The cells can be artificially reproduced by using suitable nano-materials scaffolds and other growth factors.
- **Diagnostic** : The use of nanomaterials to diagnose different diseases is the most important achievement of medical field. Nanoparticles are attached to the antibody or they can be attached to the molecules to label or to see the structures of proteins in any organism.
- **Sensing** : Lab-on-chip technology, where magnetic nano particles bound to a suitable antibody, are used to label specific molecules, structures or microorganisms. Gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample.
	- ##### Carbon Quantum Dots (CQD)
		- CQDs are **carbon-based nanomaterials** whose size is less than 10 nm.
			- ![Pasted image 20230302082446.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230302082446.png)
			- Recently scientists created quantum dots from tea leaves.
		- A team of scientists in **Council of Scientific & Industrial Research-North East Institute of Science and Technology (CSIR-NEIST), Assam** has developed a chemical process that turns ‘dirty’ coal into a biomedical ‘dot’ to help detect cancer cells.
			- They have applied for a patent for their chemical method of producing Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) from **cheap, abundant, low-quality and high-sulphur coals.**
			- Carbon-based nanomaterials are used as diagnostic tools for **bio-imaging**, especially in **detecting cancer cells,** for **chemical sensing** and in **optoelectronics**. 
			- The CQDs that the CSIR-NEIST team developed emit a bluish colour with high-stability. 
			- The developed CQDs are cheaper than imported CQD. 
			- **Environment-friendly:** The process can also be recycled with a manageable supply chain.
- Antiviral nano coating on face masks and Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits.
- **ANANYA** - nano technology based spray to combat COVID-19 (defence institute of advanced technology)
### Defence
- Possible supplement to traditional weaponry for close combat situations. Precision guiding tools for snipers and others who use fire motor shells.
### Agriculture
![Pasted image 20210427174649.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210427174649.png)
Nanotechnology in Agriculture is an emerging field that Indian agriculture has to give more focus.
- Bio indicators can be used to detect the bio magnification of pesticides and fertilizers.
- **Nanotechnology for Crop Biotechnology** : Nanoparticles can serve as ‘magic bullets’, containing herbicides, chemicals, or genes, which target particular plant parts to release their content. Nanocapsules can enable effective penetration of herbicides through cuticles and tissues, allowing slow and constant release of the active substances.
- **Nanotech Delivery Systems for Pests, Nutrients, and Plant Hormones**: Nano-sensors and nano-based smart delivery systems could help in the efficient use of agricultural natural resources like water, nutrients and chemicals through precision farming. Through the use of nanomaterials and global positioning systems with satellite imaging of fields, farm managers could remotely detect crop pests or evidence of stress such as drought. Once pest or drought is detected, there would be automatic adjustment of pesticide applications or irrigation levels.
- Through nanotechnology, scientists are able to study plant’s regulation of hormones such as auxin, which is responsible for root growth and seedling establishment.
- **Nano-sensors** dispersed in the field can also detect the presence of plant viruses and the level of soil nutrients. 
- ==Nano-encapsulated slow release fertilizers have also become a trend to save fertilizer consumption and to minimize environmental pollution.== 
	- Recently, the **Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO)** introduced the **world's first Nano Urea Liquid** for farmers across the world. - **Nano-barcodes and nano-processing** could also be used to monitor the quality of agricultural produce. e.g.  Scientists at Cornell University used the concept of grocery barcodes for cheap, efficient, rapid and easy decoding and detection of diseases.
![Pasted image 20210427175110.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210427175110.png)

### Energy
- Solar paints or photovoltaic paints – can replace solar panels. Applying solar paints to any surface will enable it to capture energy from the sun and transform it into electricity. This can be used in houses and cars.
- Wind power generations – ==nano generators== – these are flexible thin sheets which when bent can generate potential power. It can used for charging of electronic gadgets in the absence of a power source.
- Nanobatteries – these are used to help rechargeable lithium-ion batteries last longer.
### FOOD
Nanotechnology offers some exciting potential benefits for the quality and safety of our foods.
- **Anti-microbial nano-emulsions** are used for decontamination of food equipment. e.g., nanosilver has antibacterial properties.
- **Contamination Sensor** : Flash a light to reveal the presence of E. coli bacteria.
- **Antimicrobial Packaging** : Edible food films made with cinnamon or oregano oil, or nano particles of zinc, calcium other materials that kill bacteria.
- **Improved Food Storage** : Nano-enhanced barrier keeps oxygen-sensitive foods fresher.
- **Enhanced Nutrient Delivery:** Nano-encapsulating improves solubility of vitamins, antioxidants, healthy omega oils and other ‘nutraceuticals’.
- **Green Packaging:** Nano-fibers made from lobster shells or organic corn are both antimicrobial and biodegradable.
- **Pesticide Reduction:** A cloth saturated with nano fibers slowly releases pesticides, eliminating need for additional spraying and reducing chemical leakage into the water supply.
- **Tracking, Tracing; Brand Protection:** Nanobarcodes can be created to tag individual products and trace outbreaks.
- **Texture:** Food spreadability and stability improve with nano-sized crystals and lipids for better low-fat foods.
- **Flavor:** Trick the tongue with bitter blockers or sweet and salty enhancers.
- **Bacteria Identification and Elimination:** Nano carbohydrate particles bind with bacteria so they can be detected and eliminated.
### Electronics and computing
- Nanotechnology could be used to reduce the size of transistors used in integrated circuits.
- Researchers are developing a type of memory chip with a projected density of one terabyte of memory per square inch and this increases the density of memory chips.
- By improving display screens on electronics devices and this reduces power consumption and also the weight and thickness of the screens.  
- By traditional scaling limits in standard CMOS technology. This development of nano electronic components are called as ‘Beyond CMOS’ domain of development.
- **Nano-RAM** : It is a non-volatile RAM (Random Access Memory) based on carbon nanotubes deposited on a chip-like substrate. Its small size permits very high-density memories.
- Nano optomechanical SRAM (Static RAM): This shows faster read/write time as compared to a MEMS memory. Also, the processes take place without interference which further reduces time when compared to a traditional electrical enabled SRAM.
- Nanophotonics aims to build up circuits entirely driven by photons (light) OPIC - Organic Photonic Integrated Circuit
### TEXTILES
- The textile industry could be affected quite significantly by nanotechnology, with some estimates talking of a market impact of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. 
- Nanoscience has already produced **stain-and wrinkle-resistant clothing**, and future developments will focus on upgrading existing functions and performances of textile materials; and developing “smart” textiles with unprecedented functions. e.g. A team from IIT Delhi has engineered a **self-cleaning technology** to be used in the textile industry.
### ENVIRONMENT
- Besides lighter cars and machinery that requires less fuel, and alternative fuel and energy sources, there are many eco-friendly applications for nanotechnology, such as materials that provide clean water from polluted water sources in both large-scale and portable applications, and ones that detect and clean up environmental contaminants.
- Nanotechnology could help meet the need for affordable, clean drinking water through rapid, low-cost detection of impurities in and filtration and purification of water.
- Nanoparticles can be used to clean industrial water pollutants in ground water through chemical reactions that render them harmless, at much lower cost than methods that require pumping the water out of the ground for treatment.
- Researchers have developed a nanofabric “paper towel,” woven from tiny wires of potassium manganese oxide, that can absorb 20 times its weight in oil for cleanup applications.
- Many Airplane cabin and other types of air filters are nanotechnology-based filters that allow “mechanical filtration,” in which the fiber material creates nanoscale pores that trap particles larger than the size of the pores. They also may contain charcoal layers that remove odors.
- New nanotechnology-enabled sensors and solutions can be able to detect, identify, and filter out, and/or neutralize harmful chemical or biological agents in the air and soil with much higher sensitivity than is possible today.

### TRANSPORT
-  In addition to contributing to building and maintaining lighter, smarter, more efficient, and “greener” vehicles, aircraft, and ships, nanotechnology offers various means to improve the transportation infrastructure:
- Nano-engineering of steel, concrete, asphalt, and other cementitious materials, and their recycled forms, offers great promise in terms of improving the performance, resiliency, and longevity of highway and transportation infrastructure components while reducing their cost. New systems may incorporate innovative capabilities into traditional infrastructure materials, such as the ability to generate or transmit energy.
- Nanoscale sensors and devices may provide cost-effective continuous structural monitoring of the condition and performance of bridges, tunnels, rails, parking structures, and pavements over time. 
- Nanoscale sensors and devices may also support an enhanced transportation infrastructure that can communicate with vehicle-based systems to help drivers maintain lane position, avoid collisions, adjust travel routes to circumnavigate congestion, and other such activities.
### SPACE
- Employing materials made from carbon nanotubes to reduce the weight of spaceships while retaining or even increasing the structural strength.
- Using carbon nanotubes to make the cable needed for the **space elevator**, a system which could significantly reduce the cost of sending material into orbit.
- Including layers of bio-nano robots in spacesuits.
- Producing thrusters for spacecraft that use MEMS devices to accelerate nanoparticles.
- Using carbon nanotubes to build lightweight solar sails that use the pressure of light from the sun reflecting on the mirror-like solar cell to propel a spacecraft. This solves the problem of having to lift enough fuel into orbit to power spacecraft during interplanetary missions.
- Working with Nanosensors to monitor the levels of trace chemicals in spacecraft to monitor the performance of life support systems.

### Nanobots (Nano-robots)
- Nanobots are based on Nanotechnology which involves manipulation of matter on atomic and molecular level. 
- Nanobots are devices whose size falls in the range of 0.1-10 micrometres. 
- Not very long back, they were put in the hypothetical realm which means that they had not been brought into reality. But, now researchers have developed nanobots for various purposes – for killing off tumours, for instance.
- It can be used for hematology, detection and treatment of cancer, for fighting bio-hazards like epidemics.
- Nano-robots can be used to clear oil spill & dis-assemble pollutants especially non-biodegradable ones reducing their polluting impact. - Nano-robots made of silica can be used in dental procedures. The material embedded inside the robot has a magnetic moment that follows the applied magnetic field and causes the nanorobot to move precisely.
### Use of Nanosheets
- to detect uric acid on urine.
- alcohol in breath (concentrations of even less than 3%).
- check glucose in blood.
- to detect toxic chemicals in any liquid.
- pesticides or any contaminants in drinking water.
## Nanotechnology in India
### Initiatives taken 
- Research and work on nanotechnology in India started in 2001 with the formation of the **Nano Science and Technology Initiative (NSTI)** with initial funding of Rs. 60 crores. With focus on issues related to **infrastructure development,** research and application programmes related to nanomaterials including drugs, drug delivery, gene targeting and DNA chips.
- In 2007, the GOI launched a 5-year program called [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TOC#National Mission on Nano Science and Technology Nano Mission\|Nano Mission]] it was allocated a budget of Rs 1,000 crores.
- **Centres of Excellence in Nanoelectronics** : Two nano-electronics centres have been established at IIT Bombay and IISc, Bangalore. These centres have become Centres of Excellence in Nanoelectronics and are attracting International and National attention. 
	- The Centres at IIT Bombay and IISc are concentrating on development of nano-systems for healthcare and environmental monitoring, development of organic and biopolymer devices, GaN devices, acoustic sensors, magnetic materials for LC resonators, ferroelectrics for FRAMs and phase shifters etc.
- **Non-silicon based nano fabrication and nanoscales devices** : A large project has been initiated recently at IIT Delhi for creating a centre of nanoelectronics to primarily work on non-silicon based nano technology. This will concentrate largely on Nanomagnetics, Nanophotonics, Nanophotovoltaics, Nanoelectronics, Nanomechanics, Biosensors and Mesoscale Devices.
- **Nano-metrology**: In the area of nano technology, the challenges include measurement of nano dimensions, nano electrical properties etc. To meet this requirement, calibration facilities for the electrical parameters namely nanovolt, nano-scale current, nano-scale resistance and nano-scale charge have been developed and established at **National Physical Laboratory** to serve as a national facility.
- **Facility for the growth and characterization of Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes** : The facility for the growth and characterization of Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes is being created at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi.
### INDIA’S INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS
Several bilateral collaborations emerged in nano science and technology, as it was a part of nearly all the Science & Technology agreements between India and other countries.

- Initiatives for joint R&D have figured prominently with Indian institutes engaging in projects of similar kind in the US, EU, Japan, Taiwan and Russia.
- The S&T departments of Brazil, South Africa and India have embarked on a tri-lateral initiative to developed collaborative programmes in several common areas of interest, and nanotechnology being one of them.
- Other initiatives include Science and Technology Initiatives with Indian Diaspora - **Scientists and Technologists of Indian Origin Abroad (STIOs)** for encouraging networking between Indian scientists and scientists and technologists of Indian origin that are based abroad. - The International Science and Technology Directorate (ISAD) of the (CSIR) [[Council of Science and Industrial Research\|Council of Science and Industrial Research]] that aims to strengthen cooperation between CSIR and international institutions has facilitated workshops and collaborative projects with international partners like South Africa, France, South Korea, China, Japan in the area of Nanoscience and technology.
- Another forum for international collaboration is the Euro-India Net set up under the FP6 between EU and India to encourage collaborations between scientists from the 2 regions in the area of nanotechnology. A memorandum of understanding also has been signed between India and UNESCO to establish a Regional Centre for Education and Training in Biotechnology, where one of the focus areas is on nano-biotechnology.
### Results of these initiatives
- India has published about 25,000 papers in Nanoscience.
- India ranked 3rd in papers published in 2018 behind only the USA and China.
- There have been many patent applications in this field.
### National Mission on Nano Science and Technology (Nano Mission)
**Department of Science and Technology (DST) is the nodal agency for implementing the nano mission.**
1. It is an umbrella programme for capacity building which envisages the overall development of this field of research in the country and to tap some of its applied potential for nation’s development.
2. Basic research promotion by creation of centres of excellence for pursuing studies.
3. Infrastructure Development for nano research by establishing a chain of shared facilities across the country.
4. Promoting application-oriented R&D Projects, Nano-Technology Business Incubators etc. Special effort will be made to involve the industrial sector into nanotechnology R&D directly.
5. Human Resource Development through effective education and training to researchers.
6. International Collaborations through Joint research projects, academia-industry partnerships.
Nanotechnology could be both relevant and appropriate to sustainable development practices in India. Therefore, it is necessary to develop responsible nanotechnology governance.
### Roadblocks in the development of nanotechnology
- India spends only a fraction of the amount spent by countries such as the USA, China, Japan, etc. on nanotechnology.
- The quality of research is also to be improved significantly. Only a small percentage of the papers from India figures in the top 1% of publications.
- Only 0.2% of the patents filed in the US Patent Office are from India in this field.
- There are very few students who take up this field.
- The target number of PhD's in nanotechnology is 10000 per year by the Ministry of HRD. Which is difficult achieve.
- The contribution of the private sector is minimal in this domain. Even though there is a lot of potential, the private sector is yet to show tremendous enthusiasm.

## Challenges associated with Nano-technology
1. **Health and environmental impact**. They disrupt cellular, enzymatic and other organ related functions posing health hazards. Some are non-biodegradable. **Nanotoxicology** is the study of **potential health risks of nanomaterials.**
2. **Information asymmetry** between developed and developing countries.
3. Lack of infrastructure and human resources. There is poor **lab-firm integration**, which is compounded by the scarcity of skilled manpower.
4. High costs of technology due to [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/Issues relating to IPR\|IPR]].
5. Governance issues because nanotechnology is multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary.
6. Ethical consequences. For instance nanotechnology may be used in warfare, may invade people’s privacy, or may impinge on the relationship between human beings and technology.
7. **Nanopollution** : is the generic term that is used to describe the waste generated by the nanodevices or nanomaterials during the manufacturing process.

# AWARENESS IN THE FIELD OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
>Biotechnology is the process using living organisms or their enzymes or their molecules to obtain products or to develop processes for the welfare of humankind. #definition 

Humans started experimenting on biotechnology ever since the beginning of agriculture, mostly in the form of selective breeding of plants and animals. Later we learnt the art of fermentation, which promoted food production and medicines. Modern biotechnology is now capable of even manipulating the genetic makeup of an organism.
- Paul Berg is known as father of Biotechnology. The phrase 'biotechnology' was coined by the Hungarian engineer Karl Ereky in 1919.
- Biotechnology harnesses cellular and bio-molecular processes to develop technologies and products that help us to improve our lives. 
- In accordance with its various applications, branches of Biotechnology have been derived - **Blue biotechnology (marine and aquatic application)**, **Green biotechnology (agriculture processes)**, **Red biotechnology (medical)** and **White biotechnology (industrial)**.
- India's biotechnology industry comprising bio-pharmaceuticals, bio-services, bio-agriculture, bio-industry, and bioinformatics is expected to grow at an average growth rate of around 30 percent a year and reach US$ 100 billion by 2025. ## Applications of Biotechnology
### Medical Biotechnology
- Producing medical products that can be used for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases.
	- Genetically altered microorganisms such as E coli or yeast for the production of materials like insulin or antibiotics. Genetically modified mammalian cells, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells which are also extensively used to manufacture pharmaceuticals.
	- [[Gene therapy\|Gene therapy]] - which involves correction of a genetic disorder through delivery of a normal (functional) gene into the individual.

# Gene therapy
>In **gene therapy**, the effect of a faulty/mutated gene is offset by inserting a “healthy” version of the gene (therapeutic gene), and the disease-related **genes** remain in the **genome**. Whereas in [[Gene editing\|Gene editing]], a mutated gene is revised, removed, or replaced at the DNA level.
- Gene therapy was conceptualized in 1972.
- Recent announcement of **National Guidelines for Gene Therapy Product Development and Clinical Trials** by ICMR for developing and performing gene therapies to tackle inherited genetic or rare diseases in India, highlights the importance of Gene Therapy.
- Gene therapy may be classified into two types:
	- Somatic Cell gene therapy (SCGT) : 
		- The therapeutic genes are transferred into any cell other than a gamete, germ cell, gametocyte, or undifferentiated stem cell. Any such modifications affect the individual patient only, and are not inherited by offspring. 
		- Severe single gene, genetic disorders, including immuno-deficiencies, haemophilia, thalassaemia, and cystic fibrosis are good candidates for somatic cell therapy. 
		- The complete correction of a genetic disorder or the replacement of multiple genes is not yet possible. Only a few of the trials are in the advanced stage.
	- Germline Gene Therapy (GGT): 
		- In GGT, germ cells (sperm or egg cells) are modified by the introduction of functional genes into their genomes. Modifying a germ cell causes all the organism's cells to contain the modified gene. The change is therefore heritable and passed on to later generations. 
		- Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Switzerland, and the Netherlands prohibit GGT for application in human beings, for technical and ethical reasons, including insufficient knowledge about possible risks to future generations and higher risks versus SCGT.
- Vectors : Used for the delivery of therapeutic genes into cells. This can be accomplished by multiple methods. The two major classes are recombinant viruses (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and naked DNA or DNA complexes (non-viral methods). 
	- Recombinant DNA technology using viruses : A number of viruses have been used for human gene therapy, including retroviruses, adenoviruses, herpes simplex, vaccinia, and adeno-associated virus.
		-  ![A-single-dna-molecule-made-from-two-different-organisms-dna-625x290.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/A-single-dna-molecule-made-from-two-different-organisms-dna-625x290.jpg)
	- Methods for non-viral gene therapy include the injection of naked DNA, electroporation, the gene gun, sonoporation, magnetofection, the use of oligonucleotides, lipoplexes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles. 
## Potential medical uses
### Gene doping.
Athletes may adopt gene therapy technologies to improve their performance.
### Genetic engineering in Human beings
- Genetic engineering could be used to cure diseases, but also to change physical appearance, metabolism, and even improve physical capabilities and mental faculties such as memory and intelligence. 
- For parents, genetic engineering could be seen as another child enhancement technique to add to diet, exercise, education, training, cosmetics, and plastic surgery.
### Treatment of genetic diseases
- Diseases such as sickle cell disease that are caused by autosomal recessive disorders for which a person's normal phenotype or cell function may be restored in cells that have the disease by a normal copy of the gene that is mutated, may be a good candidate for gene therapy treatment.
- The risks and benefits related to gene therapy for sickle cell disease are not known.
## Adverse effects, contraindications and hurdles for use
- Short-lived nature : Problems with integrating therapeutic DNA into the genome and the rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevent it from achieving long-term benefits. Patients require multiple treatments.
- Immune response : Any time a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system is stimulated to attack the invader. Stimulating the immune system in a way that, it reduces gene therapy's effectiveness.
- Problems with viral vectors : Viral vectors carry the risks of toxicity, inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues.
- Multigene disorders : Some commonly occurring disorders, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and diabetes, are affected by variations in multiple genes, which complicate gene therapy.
- Some therapies may breach the **Weismann barrier** (between soma and germ-line) protecting the testes, potentially modifying the germline, falling afoul of regulations in countries that prohibit the latter practice.
- Insertional mutagenesis : If the DNA is integrated in a sensitive spot in the genome, for example in a tumor suppressor gene, the therapy could induce a tumor.
- Cost : Alipogene tiparvovec or Glybera, for example, at a cost of $1.6 million per patient, was reported in 2013 to be the world's most expensive drug.

# Stem cell therapy
>Broadly speaking, Stem cell is a naïve/immature/unspecialized cell that can
i. divide to form similar cells (self renewal) and
ii. develop into different specialized cells that perform distinct function

## Classification of Stem Cells
- Depending on their ability (potency) to develop into different specialized cells, stem cells can be divided into
	- Totipotent – can form all cells of the body including the ones in the extra embryonic membranes (placenta). In humans, the 2 cell staged zygote is totipotent.
	- Pluripotent – can become virtually any cell in the body except those needed to support and develop a fetus in the womb (placenta and umbilical cord)
	- Multipotent (limited ability to differentiate) - can give rise only to a small number of different cell types. e.g.. bone marrow contains multipotent stem cells that can give rise to all blood cell types but not other cells. Intestinal stem cells (renew every 45 days)
	- Unipotent – These stem cells can produce only one cell type but have the property of self-renewal that distinguishes them from non-stem cells. Found in adult tissues, unipotent stem cell has the lowest differential potential of all the stem cells. e.g., germ line stem cell (producing sperm) and an epidermal stem cell (producing skin).
	- ![Pasted image 20230406144818.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230406144818.png)
- Depending on from where they come from different places in the body or are formed at different times in our lives. These include: 
	- Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) which exist only at the earliest stages of development.
	- Adult stem cells also called somatic stem cells that appear during fetal development and are present in different tissues of our bodies throughout life.
	- Induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs cells are not found in the body but engineered in a laboratory from cells of the body, such as those from the skin. The iPSC cells have properties similar to those of embryonic stem cells.
		- Reprograming adult cells to become pluripotent was awarded Nobel prize in 2012.
		- Take any differentiated cell/somatic cell/adult cell (not adult stem cell) and induce the 4 transcription factors, it can reverse itself into an embryonic stem cell. 
		- This reprogrammed cell is called induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPS cells) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells.  
		- Once you get iPS cells you can culture them in-vitro and make them differentiate into different cell types like skin, neutrons, muscles etc. 
		- iPS cells hold promise in both regenerative medicine (tissue engineering/organ transplantation) and drug development.
		- ![Pasted image 20230406145625.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230406145625.png)
A fertilised egg has a totipotency for about 3-4 days. It then remains turns into a multipotent cell. Finally specializes further.

## Stem Cell Therapy (SCT)
- It is a type of treatment option that uses a patient’s own stem cells to repair damaged tissue and repair injuries.
- It is used to treat more than 80 disorders including neuromuscular and degenerative disorders. eg. Bone-marrow transplant is used in Leukemia (blood cancer), sickle-cell anemia, immunodeficiency disorders. 
- Stem cells are usually taken from one of the two areas in the patient’s body: bone marrow or adipose (fat) tissue in their upper thigh/abdomen. Because it is common to remove stem cells from areas of stored body fat, some refer to stem cell therapy as “Adipose Stem Cell Therapy” in some cases.
- Once stem cells are removed from one of these locations, they are placed in a “centrifuge machine” that spins them very, very quickly and concentrates the substances that are most valuable (including up to seven different types of natural growth factors).
- The sample of concentrated stem cells is then injected directly into the patient’s affected, painful area− allowing the cells’ growth factors to go to work immediately, building new skin cells, connective tissue and so on.
- Stem cells from humans can be introduced in pigs to grow organs in them as they have a faster life cycle. 
## Advantages of SCT
- **Immense Medical Benefits**: It offers a lot of medical benefits in the therapeutic cloning and regenerative medicine
- **Treatment of Conditions and Disorders**: It shows great potential in the treatment of a number of conditions like Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, cancer, diabetes and many others.
- **A Better Knowledge of human growth**: It helps the researchers know more about the growth of human cells and their development.
- The stem cell research can allow the scientists to test a number of potential medicines and drugs without carrying out any test on animals and humans. The drug can be tested on a population of cells directly.
- **Cure development defects before they happen**: The stem cell therapy also allows researchers to study the developmental stages that cannot be known directly through the human embryo and can be used in the treatment of a number of birth defects, infertility problems and also pregnancy loss. A higher understanding will allow the treatment of the abnormal development in the human body.
- **Reduced risk of rejection**: The stem cell therapy puts into use the cells of the patient’s own body and hence the risk of rejection can be reduced because the cells belong to the same human body.
## Application areas of SCT
- Orthopedic injuries and musculoskeletal problems
- Wounds and incisions following surgeries
- Spinal cord injuries, brain trauma and spinal stenosis
- Cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke and congestive heart failure
- Hair loss
- Vision impairment
- Diabetes and other pancreatic dysfunctions
- Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s
## India and Stem Cell Therapy
- According to the Indian Council of Medical research, all stem cell therapy in India considered to be experimental except bone marrow transplants.
- Stem cell therapy is legalized in India.
- Umbilical cord and adult stem cell treatment are considered permissible.
- Embryonic stem cell therapy and research is restricted.
- To find healthy donors for stem cell transplantation, a database called National Stem Cell Registry is maintained in India. 
## Challenges in SCT
- **Destruction of blastocysts**: The use of the stem cells for research involves the destruction of the blastocysts that are formed from the laboratory fertilization of the human egg.
- **Unknown side-effects**: Like any other new technology, it is completely unknown what the long-term effects of such an interference with nature could be
- **Limitations of adult cells**: The disadvantage of adult stem cells is that the cells of a particular origin would generate cells only of that type, like brain cells would generate only brain cells and so on.
- **Potential Rejection**: If the cells used in the therapy are embryonic, then the cells will not be from the same human body and there are chances of rejection.
- **Potential use in negative activities**: It can be used to create bio-weapons or weapons of mass destruction.
-  Making iPS cells takes a lot of time.

# Gene editing
>Gene editing or genome editing is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of an organism using engineered nucleases or "molecular scissors"
## Various gene editing tools
- [[CRISPR-Cas9 technology\|CRISPR-Cas9 technology]]

## Human genome editing
### Gene edited babies
- A Chinese researcher, He Jiankui has reportedly created the world's first gene edited babies. 
	- He used [[CRISPR-Cas9 technology\|CRISPR-Cas9 technology]] to edit a human embryo to stop HIV from passing down from father to the children.
	- He disabled a gene called CCR5, which is responsible for creating the protein pathways through which various viruses infect human cells.
- This has started a debate on the potential benefits and dangers of gene editing poses to the human race.
## Benefits of gene editing
- Can be used to treat many diseases and genetic disorders like HIV/AIDS, hemophilia etc. 
- Could substantially increase disease resistance and life span.
- could help to produce highly effective and cost efficient antibiotics.
- can be used to grow healthier food, via [[Food Fortification\|Food Fortification]] and increase harvest.
- Potential to slow down the spread of diseases by eliminating means of transmission. e.g. gene editing can be used to introduce sterile mosquitoes to the environment.
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Gene editing can be used to protect endangered species or bring to life extinct species. 

</div></div>

## Human genome editing in India
- Currently banned in India. 
	- Germline gene editing is prohibited in India, due to ethical and social considerations.
- It is important to have continuing public deliberation to decide whether or not germline editing should be permissible.
## Challenges in Gene editing
- Against the order of the nature.
- Available only to the rich, which perpetuate income inequalities.
- Concerns over ‘**Designer Babies**’.
- Safety concerns have been raised regarding genome editing in human germline.
- A ‘**gene drive**’ can propagate a set of genes with negative traits throughout a population which may lead to disappearance of whole targeted population with severe ecological consequences.
- At present there is no regulating body to keep a check on the practices and applications of the technology. There are at present no standard norms for standardisation of norms for clinical trials for checking the efficacy of the treatment.
- The precise genetic modifications obtained through CRISPR-Cas9 technique makes it more difficult to identify a genetically modified organism once outside the lab. This could create chaos.
## Way forward
- Codification of standards and principles of [[Bioethics\|Bioethics]].
- Establish a regulatory body to monitor the practices and applications of gene editing technologies.

# CRISPR-Cas9 technology
In the last few years, targeted genome editing using “CRISPR/Cas9” (“clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9”) has captivated the attention of the research community. The applications of this technology  have gained significant traction in various fields of science, including agriculture.

- CRISPR/Cas9 was originally identified and adapted from a naturally-occurring immunity mechanism in bacteria, which is employed against invading viruses (bacteriophages). 
	- The bacteria basically capture snippets of DNA from the viruses and use them to create CRISPR arrays. 
	- These DNA segments allow the bacteria to “remember” the viruses. In the event of the viruses attacking, the bacteria produce RNA (messenger that carries genetic information from the DNA) from the CRISPR arrays. 
	- The bacteria then uses Cas9 enzyme, which acts as a pair of “molecular scissors”, to cut the DNA apart and disabling the virus.
- The same system has been engineered by researchers to produce RNA complementary to a specific target DNA sequence in the genome of an organism. 
	- This “guide” RNA binds itself only to that target sequence and no other regions of the genome. 
	- The Cas9 enzyme will, in turn, follow the guide RNA and cut the two strands of DNA at the targeted location. 
	- At this stage, the cell knows that the DNA is damaged and tries to repair it. The researchers can now use the natural DNA repair machinery to introduce changes, including by adding or deleting genetic material.
- CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been successfully demonstrated, for instance, in developing rice lines that are resistant to blast (by knocking-out genes that suppress immunity to the fungus) and bacterial leaf blight (by editing the binding sites of the disease-causing genes).
- 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Awarded for CRISPR/Cas9 'Genetic Scissors'. Emmanuelle Charpentier and American Jennifer Doudna will share the prize for developing the CRISPR/Cas9 tool to edit the DNA of animals, plants and microorganisms with precision.
## ‘Feluda’ test for COVID-19
- Feluda is the acronym for FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay.
- It is low-cost paper-based test strip to detect #COVID-19  and can deliver a result in 45 minutes.
- How it works?
	- It uses indigenously developed CRISPR gene-editing technology to identify and target the genetic material of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
	- It has a quicker turnaround time and requires less expensive equipment.
	- ‘Feluda’ is also the world’s first diagnostic test to deploy a specially adapted Cas9 protein to successfully detect the virus.
## [[GM crops\|GM crops]] vs genome edited crops
- Globally, regulatory policies for genome edited crops, as opposed to transgenic or GMOs, are in different stages of implementation. 
	- Countries with available regulatory processes for genome edited lines include the United States, Canada, Argentina, Israel, Chile, Brazil, Australia and Japan. 
	- Regulatory agencies in India are still deliberating over the extent of regulation required for crop plants developed through gene editing, which does not involve addition of DNA from totally unrelated species.
## Way forward
- Need rational analyses of the risks and benefits that the new gene editing  technology offers in each scenario
- Need to strengthen our research efforts in scientific technologies that offer the most benefit to society through strategic funding, collaborations or even public-private partnerships
- We need clear regulatory frameworks for the application of these technologies. 

Every step we take could help reduce hunger and improve the quality of life for ourselves and future generations.

# Biotechnology in vaccine development
The techniques of modern **biotechnology** such as genetic engineering and cell culture enable an effective, quick and economical **development** of **vaccines**.
- Advances in technology are accelerating the search for drugs and vaccines to arm the immune system against #COVID-19 e.g. 
	- The DNA vaccine (for spike protein) by Zydus Cadilla, if successful, would be the first DNA vaccine to be ever used for any disease.
	- mRNA vaccine by Moderna.
	- self amplifying mRNA vaccine (Sa-mRNA) by Gennova.
	- Johnson and Johnson adenovirus based vaccine.
- Biotechnology is used in three different ways in the development of vaccine:
	- Separation of a pure antigen using a specific monoclonal antibody.  
	- Synthesis of an antigen with the help of a cloned gene. 
	- Synthesis of peptides to be used as vaccines.

## mRNA vaccine
- Unlike a normal vaccine, RNA vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence which is coded for a disease specific antigen.  #definition 
- Once produced within the body, the antigen is recognised by the immune system, preparing it to fight the real thing. 
- mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.
- mRNA vaccines can be delivered using a number of methods, via needle-syringe injections or needle-free into the skin, injection into the blood, muscle, lymph node or directly into organs; or via a nasal spray. 
- There are different types of mRNA vaccine like Non-replicating mRNA, In vivo self-replicating mRNA, In vitro dendritic cell non-replicating mRNA vaccine etc.
### Benefits of mRNA vaccines

## DNA Vaccine
- A DNA vaccine is a type of vaccine that transfects a specific antigen-coding DNA sequence into the cells of an organism as a mechanism to induce an immune response. #definition 
- DNA vaccines have theoretical advantages over conventional vaccines, including the "ability to induce a wider range of types of immune response". Several DNA vaccines have been tested for veterinary use.
- In August 2021, Indian authorities gave emergency approval to ZyCoV-D. Developed by Cadilla Healthcare, it is the first DNA vaccine approved for humans.
- ![Pasted image 20230214144954.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230214144954.png)
- DNA immunization can be used as a technology platform for monoclonal antibody induction.
- ![Pasted image 20230214175252.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230214175252.png)
	- DNA vaccine and Gene therapy techniques are similar.
- Delivery:
	- Saline injection
	- Gene gun (Gene gun delivery ballistically accelerates plasmid DNA (pDNA) that has been absorbed onto gold or tungsten microparticles into the target cells, using compressed helium as an accelerant)
	- Mucosal surface delivery
	- Polymer vehicle (A hybrid vehicle composed of bacteria cell and synthetic polymers has been employed for DNA vaccine delivery)
	- ELI immunization (Using expression library immunization (ELI) technique, potentially all the genes from a pathogen can be delivered at one time, which may be useful for pathogens that are difficult to attenuate or culture.
- Advantages
	- No risk for infection
	- Antigen presentation by both MHC class I and class II molecules
	- Immune response focused on the antigen of interest
	- Ease of development and production
	- Stability for storage and shipping
	- Cost-effectiveness
	- Long-term persistence of immunogen
- Disadvantages
	- Limited to protein immunogens (not useful for non-protein based antigens such as bacterial polysaccharides)
	- Potential when using nasal spray administration of plasmid DNA nanoparticles to transfect non-target cells, such as brain cells
	- Cross-contamination when manufacturing different types of live vaccines in same facility.

# Genome Sequencing
>A genome is an organism’s complete set of DNA, including all its genes. It contains all the information needed to build and maintain that organism. Genome mapping/sequencing: It means deciphering the exact order of base pairs in an individual. 
## Human genome
![Pasted image 20230214182440.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230214182440.png)
- The human genome is conventionally divided into the “coding” genome, which generates the ~20,000 annotated human protein coding genes, and the “dark” genome, which does not encode proteins.
- The dark genome is a vast space, accounting for the ~98.5% of genomic space where repeat elements, enhancers, regulatory sequences, and non-coding RNAs reside.
- Researchers investigating the “dark genome” report that they have discovered recently evolved regions that code for proteins associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
## Relevance of Genome sequencing
![Pasted image 20210511152948.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210511152948.png)
- By sequencing the genome, researchers can discover the functions of genes and identify which of them are critical for life.
- There is interest among private and public companies in sequencing genomes thanks to the declining costs for the process.
- From China to the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, several countries have announced plans to sequence their population.
- Currently, genomic data sets under-represent Asia, particularly India, whose population and diverse ethnicity make it an attractive prospect for genome-mining efforts.
- Genome sequencing is crucial to track SARS-CoV-2, and other virus variants.
- Detailed genome map of malaria vector will help to achieve the national goal of malaria elimination by 2030.
- Genome sequencing can help research on improving genetic potential of plants. e.g. genome decoding of hybrid rubber(RRRII 105) by RRRII

## Human Genome Project (HGP)
- It was the international research effort to determine the DNA sequence of the entire human genome.
- It began in 1990 and completed in 2003.
- The HGP gave us the ability, for the first time, to read nature's complete genetic blueprint for building a human being.
- It was coordinated by the National Institutes of Health, USA and the Department of Energy, USA.
## Genome India Initiative
- The initiative aims to make predictive diagnostic markers available for some priority diseases such as cancer and other rare and genetic disorders
- The first phase involves sequencing of complete genomes of nearly 10,000 Indians from all corners of the country and captures the biological diversity of India.
- In the next phase, about 10,000 “diseased individuals” would have their genomes sequenced.
- These vast troves of data sets would be compared using machine learning techniques to identify genes that can predict cancer risk, as well as other diseases that could be significantly influenced by genetic anomalies.
- 22 institutions, including those from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the DBT would be involved in the exercise.
- The data generated would be accessible to researchers anywhere for analysis.
- This would be through a proposed National Biological Data Centre envisaged in a policy called the ‘Biological Data Storage, Access and Sharing Policy’, which is still in early stages of discussion.
### Benefits of GII
- Personalised medicine
- Prediction of health and disease outcome
- Could help in modulating treatment protocols
- Preventive care can boosted
- Anthropological study
- Forensic analysis

>By leveraging existing strengths in the medical sector, India can enter the next stage, from being the pharmacy of the world to being the biotech hub in the world. Comment.

### Animal Biotechnology
- To improve the productivity of livestock and also for development of affordable new generation vaccines and diagnostics against a plethora of animal diseases. 
- Gene editing can be used to protect endangered species or bring to life extinct species. ### Agriculture/Plant biotechnology
- Agricultural biotechnology has been practiced since ancient time as people have sought to improve agriculturally important organisms by selection and breeding.
#### Advantages biotechnology in agriculture
- Increased crop productivity: Biotechnology has made possible to increase crop productivity by introducing such qualities as disease resistance and increased drought tolerance to the crops. Currently, scientists can select genes for disease resistance from other species and transfer them to important crops.
- Improvements in food processing: Biotechnology considerably enhance the quality of food. 
- Mycorrhizal biotechnology: It has been used in rehabilitating degraded lands because mycorrhiza enables the plants to resist drought and increase the absorptive area. It also helps to tolerate extremes of pH which resists disease infestation.
- Improved nutritional value: Genetic engineering has permissible new options to improve the nutritional value, flavour, and texture of foods. [[GM crops\|transgenic crops]] in development include soybeans with higher protein content, potatoes with more nutritionally available starch and an improved amino acid content, beans with more essential amino acids, and rice with the ability produce beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, to help prevent blindness in people who have nutritionally insufficient diets.
- Better flavour: Through the application of biotechnology techniques, food can have good flavour. Flavour can be changed by enhancing the activity of plant enzymes that transform aroma precursors into flavouring compounds. Transgenic peppers and melons with improved flavour are currently in field trials.
- Fresher produce: Genetic engineering can result in improved shelf life to make transport of fresh produce easier, giving consumers access to nutritionally valuable whole foods and preventing decay, damage, and loss of nutrients.
- Environmental benefits: When genetic engineering results in reduced pesticide dependence, there is less pesticide residues on foods, reduce pesticide leaching into groundwater, and minimize farm worker exposure to hazardous products.

# GM crops
>Transgenic plants are those that have been genetically modified using recombinant DNA technology. GM crops involves insertion of genes of organism from another biological kingdom in order to achieve desired results. 
- India is at the 4th global position in hectarage under GM crops.
- [[Gene editing\|genome editing]] is more accurate, faster and less expensive compared to genetic modification. Genome edited crops can aid India's efforts to increase crop yield in addition to reducing dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 
	- While genetically modifying crops and animals, scientists will typically remove the preferred gene from one organism and randomly introduce it into another organism. A well-known genetically modified type of crop is Bt corn and cotton, where a bacterial gene was introduced that produces insecticidal toxins into the part of the plant where the insect eats, causing death to the insect.
	- Whereas, gene editing is a small, controlled tweak to a living organism’s existing DNA versus the introduction of a new, foreign gene. It is nearly impossible to detect whether an organism’s DNA has been edited or not because the changes are indistinguishable from naturally occurring mutations.
	-  There are several approaches to genome editing like CRISPR-Cas9, Homing endonucleases or meganucleases and Site-Directed Nuclease etc.
		- Non-Transgenic Gene Editing uses of gene editing tools to directly tweak the plant’s own genes and does not involve inserting any foreign DNA.
	- ![Pasted image 20210504180414.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210504180414.png)
- The moratorium placed on cultivation of GM Mustard has re-ignited the debate whether these GM crops be grown. 
- [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/Awareness in the field of Biotechnology#Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee GEAC\|Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)]] asked Maharashtra Government to initiate action to stop cultivation of illegal Herbicide-Tolerant variety of Bt Cotton.
	- Illegal cultivation of HT Bt cotton variant has serious environmental and economic consequences
		- Environmental issues
			- Fears about the carcinogenic effect of Glyphosate
			- possible spread of herbicide resistance to nearby plants through cross pollination. This could create variety of superweeds.
			- There is no accountability of the quality of seed
		- Economic consequences
			- Government is losing revenues in terms of tax collection
			- Industry is losing legitimate seed sale.
			- threatens legal cotton seed market in India.
- Recently [[FSSAI\|FSSAI]] issued an order setting the permissible limit for genetically modified organisms (GMO) in imported food crops at 1%.
- ![Pasted image 20230214180050.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230214180050.png)
- Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) promotes the science based  innovative technology including research on GM crops.
	- Network Project on Functional Genomics and Genetic Modification in Crops was launched by ICAR in 2005 for development of GM crops.
## Benefits of GM crops
- Better tolerance to harsh climatic conditions like, heat, drought, salinity etc. It also prevents of loss species to endemic disease. e.g. World's first GM rubber developed by Rubber Research Institute of India (RRII) tailored for the climatic conditions of Northeast.
	- It has additional copies of the gene MnSOD, or manganese-containing superoxide dismutase, inserted in the plant, which is expected to tide over the severe cold conditions during winter.
- GM crops are superior crops as they generate **better yields and are resistant to pests and diseases**. Country’s cotton production has gone up more than 21 times since Bt hybrids were first planted in 2002. This benefited farmers immensely.
- India imports thousands of tons of GM edible oil every year with no evidence of health effects or deaths due to genetic alterations. This will reduce our import burden.
- GM crops offer a solution to further enhance the India’s food security needs. Food with more desirable traits can be produced. e.g. Golden rice with Vitamin-A.
-  Maintain soil fertility: GM crops have increased efficiency of mineral usage that reduces excess use of fertilizers and prevents loss of fertility of soil
## Reasons for opposition
- Economic concerns: 
	- Introduction of GM crop is a method by which large seed producing companies attempt to monopolise the markets. GM seeds are found to carry a **terminator gene** that terminates the seed after a year or two.
	- GM require more water, fertilisers unlike what they are always advertised to. In the last decade, more than 250,000 farmers have killed themselves because of Monsanto’s costly seeds and pesticides.
	- There has been witnessed a decline/stagnation in yield after few years with respect to many GM crops which in turn leads to diminishing returns.
- Environmental concerns: 
	- Genetic contamination: The migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or wild species may have an indirect effect on food safety and food security.
	- Genetic erosion: Experts worry that extensive use of GM crops can wipe out crop diversity and ecosystems. GM crops harms bees and other small insects which helps in pollination along with harmful insects.
	- There is always a concern of pathogens becoming resistant to the toxins produced by GM crops. For example the pink bollworm has grown resistant to the toxins produced by BT cotton seed of Monsanto.
- Regulatory issues:
	- The [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/Awareness in the field of Biotechnology#Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee GEAC\|GEAC]] does not conduct the closed field trials on their own. There is still opacity and there is no public data on effects of GM on human health, food chain, allied sectors, etc.
	- In the absence of clear directions, a black market has developed for various unapproved GM crops. Currently Bt Cotton is the only GM crop allowed for commercial cultivation in India. However, GM variants of crops like brinjal, soya, etc are cultivated and circulated in black markets.
- Bio-safety of human and animal health and ethical concerns: 
	- People have apprehension as some studies found that GM crops brings pre-mature growth in children and other side effects. Also, cattle feeding on GM crops becomes sterile has also been found.
	-  Unregulated use of GM technology in crop can lead to excessive corporate dominance and unnaturalness of the technology.
## Way forward
-  Awareness and information: Public awareness with reliable evidence-based information on GM crops such as keeping biosafety data out of the public domain needs to be increased to take informed decisions.
- Consultation with state governments on the issue given that agriculture is a state subject. 
- Grievance redressal of all stakeholders before introduction of the GM crop.
- There should also be a liability clause, that is, if something goes wrong the liability should be fixed statutorily like in case of US law.
-  Government roadmap: The government should come up with a fresh road map for ensuring food security without jeopardising the biodiversity and compromising with the safety of human health.
- Capacity building: There is need of capacity building in GM research agenda and development with science based consistent regulatory policy from the side of Government
- Robust clinical trials: Clinical trials of GM crops need to be contingent on robust demonstration of safety and efficacy.
- Adherence to the principles of Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety which is an integral part of the Convention of Biological Diversity.


Bangladesh has allowed Bt Brinjal and there have been no side effects yet. However, still there remains some concerns. US concluded that many American farmers have achieved weed control and reduced losses from insect pests due to usage of modified crops.

# Anti Microbial Resistance (AMR)
>Anti Microbial Resistance (AMR) is the phenomenon by which bacteria and fungi evolve and become resistant to presently available medical treatment. It is one of the greatest challenge of 21st century. [[WHO\|WHO]] Director General said, "AMR is a slow tsunami that threatens to undo a century of medical progress".

- AMR is currently responsible for 7,00,000 deaths a year.
- AMR related deaths is expected to rise up to 10 million and $100 trillion loss a year by 2050.
## Factors leading to AMR
- Misuse of antimicrobials in medicine
- inappropriate use in agriculture
- contamination around pharmaceutical manufacturing sites where untreated waste releases large amounts of antimicrobials into the environment.
- New classes of antimicrobials are not being developed.
- ![Pasted image 20210506201723.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210506201723.png)

## The way forward
- A multi-sectoral **$1 billion AMR Action Fund** was launched in 2020.
- Effective action plan to curb the amount of active antibiotics released in pharmaceutical waste.
- International coordination is required to tackle this slow and silent pandemic.

# AWARENESS IN THE FIELD OF ROBOTICS
>**Robot**, any automatically operated machine (self or remote controlled) that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner. 
>>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science and engineering, which deals with the design, construction, and operation of robots. The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans.

- Fundamentally, a robot is a re-programmable machine that is capable of movement in the accomplishment of a task. Robots use special coding that differentiates them from other machines and machine tools.

## ROBOTICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
- The field of Robotics is closely related to [[Artificial Intelligence\|AI]].  AI requires sophisticated computer to perform complex problem solving tasks that require thinking and reasoning while processing vast amount of knowledge. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation navigation with sub-problems of  localisation,mapping and motion planning. 
- **Sophia** is the **first robot citizen of the world** after Saudi Arabia granted her citizenship in October 2017. She is a social humanoid robot, which using [[Artificial Intelligence\|Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) programming, can imitate human gestures and facial expressions, and is able to converse on predefined topics.
	- A humanoid robot is a robot which has resemblance like human and it is based on that of the human body, allowing interaction with made-for-human tools or environments.
## Applications of Robots
### Industrial applications of robots
Industrial robots can augment the quality of life by freeing workers from dirty, boring, hazardous and heavy labour. 
- Tasks such as welding, spray painting, loading, material handling and assembling can be performed for better by an Industrial robot than a human.
	- **Assembly robots** used in manufacturing especially auto industry - account for more than 50% of labour. Industrial robots can work vigorously night and day on an assembly line without a loss in performance. Subsequently, they can greatly reduce the costs of manufactured goods.
- **Pick and place robots** are used in mass production of PCBs (printed circuit board). They help to remove tiny electronic components from strips/trays and place them onto PCB’s with great accuracy. Such robots can place several components per second, far outperforming a human in terms of speed, accuracy and reliability.
- Industrial robots are extensively used for pelletizing ad packaging of manufactured goods. For example, taking drink cartoons from the end of conveyor and belt placing them rapidly into boxes.
- A **cobot**, or **collaborative robot**, is a robot intended for direct human robot interaction within a shared space, or where humans and robots are in close proximity. Cobot applications contrast with traditional industrial robot applications in which robots are isolated from human contact.

### Robots in Health & Medicine
Robots have great importance in the medical field where extreme precision and delicacy is essential, and the margin for error is very low. 
- ==In surgery==. Robots are able to perform major operations while only making small incisions, patients receive many benefits. e.g. Robots are used to perform heart surgery without opening patient’s chests. 
	- Recently, **AIIMS, New Delhi** has successfully performed robotic surgery where it removed thymus gland from patient suffering from ‘Myasthenia Gravis’ (A disease characterized by progressive muscular weakness, which can sometimes be life-threatening) 	- robotic assisted joint replacement surgery conducted in Kozhikode. 
	-  One such system widely used is **Da Vinci surgical systems**.
	- ==Major advantages of Robotic surgery include==:
		-  Reduced blood loss which reduces the risk of needing a blood.
		-  Smaller incision which reduces pain and shortens recovery (minimal invasive surgery)
		-  Less pain leading to less pain medication.
		-  Hospitalization time/duration of hospital stay can be reduced.
		-  Reduces the incidence of post- surgical complications.
- ==In Prosthetics== : Robotic devices can also provide help to people with severe restrictions on movement, in many cases allowing them at least some capability to move around or nearby their homes. ==Rehabilitation Robots== can provide exercise platforms to help restore limb function and can monitor the condition of patients undergoing rehabilitation from the effects of injuries, stroke or other brain or nerve damage.
-   Nanorobots in cancer treatment.
	1. 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



### Nanobots (Nano-robots)
- Nanobots are based on Nanotechnology which involves manipulation of matter on atomic and molecular level. 
- Nanobots are devices whose size falls in the range of 0.1-10 micrometres. 
- Not very long back, they were put in the hypothetical realm which means that they had not been brought into reality. But, now researchers have developed nanobots for various purposes – for killing off tumours, for instance.
- It can be used for hematology, detection and treatment of cancer, for fighting bio-hazards like epidemics.
- Nano-robots can be used to clear oil spill & dis-assemble pollutants especially non-biodegradable ones reducing their polluting impact. - Nano-robots made of silica can be used in dental procedures. The material embedded inside the robot has a magnetic moment that follows the applied magnetic field and causes the nanorobot to move precisely.

</div></div>

- In delivery of medicines - e.g. Sawai Man Singh government hospital in Jaipur used humanoid robots to deliver food and medicines and food to #COVID-19 patients.
- **XENOBOTS** 
	- Xenobots are robots constructed out of living cells including stem cells to make robots to perform specific actions. 
	- Xenobots made out of frog embryo cells are already being demonstrated. 
	- Reproduceable Xenobots have already been created.
	- Potential applications include: 
		- Environmental cleanup: Xenobots can be programmed to identify and remove toxic pollutants from the environment, such as microplastics or oil spills particularly in inaccessible areas. 
		- Medical applications: Can act as drug delivery vehicles. 
		- Agriculture: can be used to monitor soil health and crop growth
### Automobiles and as a means of transport
- Self driving cars.
- Mobile Robots act as automated guided vehicles with scanning, lasers are used to transport goods around large facilities such as warehouses, container ports or hospitals.
- Drone technology for delivery, surveillance etc.

# Drone technology
> In aviation and in space, a drone, also called an “unmanned aerial vehicle,” or UAV, refers to an unpiloted aircraft or spacecraft. UAVs are commonly used in both the military and police forces in situations where the risk of sending a human piloted aircraft is unacceptable, or the situation makes using a manned aircraft impractical. UAVs are controlled by remote ground control systems (GSC) and equipped with infrared cameras, GPS and laser (consumer, commercial and military UAV).

- DGCA in October 2014 restricted the use of drones and unmanned aircraft system by civilians.
	- The DCGA has divided the drones into five categories based on their Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) - Nano, Micro, Mini, Small, Large.
	- A **Unique Identification Number and radio frequency tags** would be a mandatory requirement for operating drones.

## Applications of Drones
- **Disaster management**: Tracking of cyclones, floods, epidemics, and range of disasters is easily possible with the use of UAVs.**Damage assessment** of property after natural calamities. e.g. American authorities successfully used UAVs to track the movement of Hurricanes. UAVs act as aerial eye for search and rescue operations worldwide.
- **Defence purpose**: use by Armed Forces for tactical purposes at border. e.g.  Indian military has drones like Lakshya, Daksh, Rustom etc. to use it in difficult terrain like Siachen glacier.
- **Law enforcement, Surveillance and Crowd Management** :  Crowd, traffic and riots can be managed well with aerial surveillance from UAVs. Recently Karnataka police used drones to identify sand mining along the border.
- [[Conservation of Biodiversity\|Conservation of Biodiversity]] : Monitoring of wildlife, Tracking of migratory birds, endangered species, anti-poaching mechanisms can easily employ UAVs for better management of their activities in preventing destruction of wildlife.
- Quality aerial mapping
- [[Precision farming#Precision farming\|precsion agriculture]] & SENSAGRI (SENsor based Smart AGRIculture)
	- UAVs are used to spray the pesticides to avoid the health problems of humans when they spray manually. UAVs can be used easily, where the equipment and labours difficulty to operate.
- many e-commerce use it for delivering products.
- For measuring weather.
- It can be used in rescue operations.
- Can be used in space exploration. e.g. Mars 2020 mission by NASA.
- In research and exploration:  e.g. Drones can be used for collecting breath samples from spouting whales for DNA analysis. 
- Drones can capture images of erupting craters that would be impossible to get otherwise. They are very practical to quickly obtain good quality terrain images and photogrammetric data in almost all volcanic environments.
- Infrastructure: Drones can inspect tall structures and monitor critical infrastructure such as ports and power plants.
- Health care: Delivery of drugs to remote areas and can complement tele-medicine initiatives.

## Cons of Drones
- Legislative Uncertainty: Since the widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles is relatively new, legislation is still catching up. There is an **issue of aerial trespassing**.
- Safety concerns regarding mid-air collisions and damage to properties and life. The airspace over Indian cities already has a high density of aircraft traffic and unregulated use of drones poses a grave threat for air collisions and accidents.
- Privacy issues: One of the most common concerns from the public about UAVs is privacy. Drones can collect data and images without drawing attention.
- Potential misuse by terrorists. e.g. **Saudi-Aramco Drone Attack**Jammu drone attack in 2021.  
	- Easy availability of drones, it would be used in all sorts of combat, both by state and non-state actors.
	- J&K administration bans drones in Srinagar.

## Way forward
- Since drones are increasingly becoming part of a networked environment, it is critical to give each drone a unique electronic code, akin to an internet protocol address, for quick, easy and clear identification.
- UAVs of today are a precursor to next generation aerospace technologies. Unless we bring in the right set of regulations, the investors would be reluctant to take a leap of faith in the development of the UAV industry.
- Offensive and defensive measures of the counter drone systems to prevent attack on critical installations.
- Kerala police forayed (stepped) into the relatively new field of drone forensics after J&K incident 
Drones offer low-cost, safe and quick aerial surveys for data collection and are useful for industries such as power, mining, realty, oil and gas exploration, railways and highways. They are also effective in relief and rescue work and in policing.
But drones can also be misused in multiple ways. Thus regulated usage of drones is necessary in today’s world.

### Societal and Domestic functions
- Home Appliances for cleaning, cooking, dish washing, personal assistants like Amazon Echo.
- Humanoid robots can perform tasks like personal assistance where they will be able to assist the sick elderly people. For example Japanese WAKAMARU domestic robot made by Mitsubishi company in 2005.
- Certain domestic robots like ROOMBA can also free us form dirty and dull tasks by taking up simple, unwanted jobs at home like vacuum cleaning and lawn mowing.
- ==Swarm robotics== : Used for coordination of multi-robot systems which consist of many simple physical robots to achieve a desired collective behaviour.
### Disaster Management and environmental applications
- Autonomous robotic systems designed to explore and map abandoned mines which pose a significant threat to society. Abandoned mines have dangerous explosion of methane gas which accumulates when they are no longer ventilated. One such automatic robotic system designed to automatically explore and acquire 3-D maps of abandoned mines s GROUNDHOG, developed by USA.
- Robots are used for firefighting, for entering into risky areas and for removing of injured persons in natural disasters. Other major applications of robots in security is for inspection and search for dangerous materials.
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Nano-robots can be used to clear oil spill & dis-assemble pollutants especially non-biodegradable ones reducing their polluting impact. 

</div></div>

- Robots can be used in nuclear plants for handling and disposal of nuclear waste materials which saves the occupational workers in the nuclear plant from potential exposure to hazardous radiations.
### Robots in agriculture
The robotics technology coupled with digital mechanization possesses potential in bringing positive transformation across agricultural landscape globally and especially in India in the backdrop of challenges like lack of favourable terms of trade, vagaries of [[Monsoon\|monsoon]], sluggish technology adaptation, productivity per yield etc.

- Examples of Robotics in Indian Agriculture 
	- PAAMA Agrico under Made-in-India. It enables a Robot to weld blades enabling the precision function – ensuring uniformity in production while facilitating repeatability function each time.
	- GRoboMac: The working of this robot has been designed in such a way that the computerized vision detects and locates the precise 3D coordinates of the bloomed cotton from the images of the cotton plant. A robotic arm uses these coordinates to pick the cotton and the arm, then uses a vacuum for precision picking of cotton and avoids picking any other contaminant. 
#### How can robotics be a game changer in agriculture?
- ==Precision Agriculture==:  Weed control using robotics and [[Machine learning\|machine learning]], to pinpoint the application of fertilizers and herbicide. Field tests have reported using only 10 percent of the herbicide needed in the past. The concept can be reversed to precisely apply fertilizer to only desired plants, thereby reducing waste while optimizing yields.
- ==Solution to lack of labour==: Robotics for agricultural activities like fruit picking, harvesting etc. For example: Large scale Orange harvesting with agricultural robots in France and USA. Example: Virgo, the robotic harvesting system.
- Full field capacity work: The robots do not get sick or tired and they do not need the time off, they offer fewer errors at higher speeds, and the higher quality products can be sensed by the machines accurately.
- ==Safety of famers and consumers==: The robots can protect the human workers from the harmful effects of handling the chemicals by hand and through the system of high spraying, and they can reduce up to 80% of a farms use of pesticides, avoiding contamination.
- ==High productivity==: Robotics mechanism closely mimics the human method of farming, but at a much higher productivity level. Increase in farmers’ income per yield and reduction in all round costs are observed. Technology adoption and efficient resource usage like robotics, AI, Digital mapping etc in these two countries are far higher, thus resulting in higher yields.
- ==Enables alternate employment and additional source of income==: Due to robotic farming, lot of time is saved for the farmers, and they can engage in alternate occupations, thus earning additional income.
- ==Reduced costs==: Agri-bots being used in several regions in India which tend to crops, harvesting, weeding etc can reduce fertilizer cost up to 90% and eliminate human labour.
- ==Attracting youth==: Robotics in agriculture can succeed in bringing and retaining the youth population of our country. ARYA #scheme	
-   **Other applications**: Nursery planting, crop analysis, animal husbandry, dairy farming, drone service, harsh terrain resilient farming etc.
#### Challenges associated with robotics in agriculture
- The capital-intensive nature of Robotics.
- High cost of procuring imported hardware components as well as training personnel.
- Unavailability of skilled labour and sluggish adaptation of technology:  Most of Indian agriculture is carried out in the rural dominated regions which entail difficulty in convincing the farmers to trust the technology over traditional farming. 
- Repair and maintenance becomes an issue, especially in India, where reach of AI knowledge has not penetrated across the country.
- Loss of various traditional, yet effectively resilient methods suitable for Indian agriculture.
- Substitution of technology may put farmers out of their jobs and render difficulties to the already suffering state of unemployment.
### Robots in space and under water exploration
- Robots can perform well in space arena where it is dangerous for humans to get to space, to be in space and to return from space.
	- Autonomous robots are used in space exploration as they can perform desired tasks in unstructured environment, without continuous human guidance.
	- Remotely operated vehicles is an unmanned spacecraft can act as Lander that makes contact with an extra- terrestrial body and operates from a stationery position or as a Rover that can more over terrain once it is landed. 
	- Robotic space crafts can acts as space probe operating in the vacuum of space and withstanding exposure to radiation and extremes of temperature in addition to some planetary destinations such as Venus or vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival.
- Underwater Robots: Robotic underwater travellers are used to reconnoitre and gather information about many aspects of marine environment. For example, robots are used for underwater cable inspection, and for telecommunications.

#### Military Applications of robotics
- Military robot in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de -activation). 	
	- Military robots are autonomous robots or remote-controlled mobile robots designed for military applications, from transport to search & rescue and attack. Military robots include UGVs, [[Drone technology\|Drones]], mobile robots and even Humanoid robots as soldiers.
- Tele Robots are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles which can be used to perform dangerous tasks in faraway/in accessible places. 
	- These robots can be controlled from anywhere in the world allowing any army to search terrain and fire on targets without endangering those using it. Hundreds of robots such as L- robot, PACKBOT are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by US military to defuse roadside bomb/ improvised explosive devices. Autonomous Robots such as SEEKUR are being developed to perform security and surveillance tasks at military facilities.

- **DRDO’s Daksh**- This made-in-India robot is primarily designed to detect and recover Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). It was inducted by Indian Army around 2011. Reportedly, 20 Daksh robots are already being used by the Indian Army. Using its X-ray vision, Daksh can identify a hazardous object and can diffuse it with a jet of water. It got an upgrade in 2015 and has been equipped with chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear hazard detection mechanisms.

### Challenges in India
- Loss of jobs. automation would result in the loss of 3 million IT jobs by 2022 - report by Bank of America.
- Absence of hardware companies that can cater to businesses and need to import.
- The cost of adopting Robotic technology is very high due to the cost of procuring imported hardware components as well as training personnel.
- Scarcity of good faculty to teach the subject. Subject is not taught to the engineering students in many colleges.
- Lack of industry - academia linkage
- As Robotics is a multidisciplinary field, acquiring and retaining quality talent is also a major issue. Scarcity of talent that specializes in the many disciplines such as electrical, embedded, software and mechanical that make up Robotics.
- The industry faces political hurdles. In spite of the Government’s focus on robotics lately, somewhere the notion that robots will destroy jobs in an already precarious job market is completely misplaced. 

## Way forward
- Include robotics in Skill India Mission.
- More private and international collaboration
- Increase fund allocation to R&D in robotics
- Legislative and policy measures to protect jobs.

Automation is the need of the hour to **enhance efficiency, productivity and optimization** across industries and sectors.

[[01-03-2021-Monday\|01-03-2021-Monday]]  10:35 AM

# Awareness in the filed of Nuclear Science
>Nuclear energy (atomic energy) is the energy that is released in significant amounts in processes called nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. ![intermediate-Top-Uranium-235-neutron-neutrons-process-tritium.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/intermediate-Top-Uranium-235-neutron-neutrons-process-tritium.jpg)
- One method of releasing nuclear energy is by **controlled nuclear fission** in devices called reactors, which now operate in many parts of the world for the production of electricity.
	- Nuclear Fission: 
		- The nucleus of an **atom splits** into two daughter nuclei.
		- This decay can be **natural** spontaneous splitting by radioactive decay, or can actually be **simulated** in a lab by achieving necessary conditions (bombarding with neutrons, alpha particles, etc.)
		- The resulting fragments tend to have a combined **mass which is less than the original.** The missing mass is usually converted into nuclear energy.
		- ZAPORIZHZHIA - Europe’s largest nuclear plant in Ukraine.
		- Currently all commercial nuclear reactors are **based on nuclear fission**
		 ![Pressurized_Water_Reactor 1200 x 900-01_0.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pressurized_Water_Reactor%201200%20x%20900-01_0.png)
		 - **Criticality** is the first step towards power production. A nuclear reactor is said to be critical when the nuclear fuel inside a reactor sustains a fission chain reaction.
- Another method for obtaining nuclear energy, controlled nuclear fusion, holds promise but has not been perfected by 2022. 
	- Nuclear Fusion:
		- Nuclear Fusion is defined as the **combining of two lighter nuclei into a heavier one**. Atoms of Tritium and Deuterium (isotopes of hydrogen, Hydrogen-3 and Hydrogen-2, respectively) unite under extreme pressure and temperature to produce a neutron and a helium isotope.
		- Such nuclear fusion reactions are the **source of energy in the Sun and other stars.**
		- It takes considerable energy to force the nuclei to fuse. The conditions needed for this process are extreme-millions of degrees of temperature and millions of pascals of pressure.
		- Fusion fuels are widely available and nearly inexhaustible.
		- Fusion does not emit [[Carbon dioxide\|Carbon dioxide]] or other [[Greenhouse gas\|Greenhouse gas]]es into the atmosphere.
		- ==Fusion of atoms releases huge amount of energy==-four times as much as nuclear fission reactions.
		- The **hydrogen bomb** is based on a thermonuclear fusion reaction. However, a **nuclear bomb based on the fission** of uranium or plutonium is **placed at the core of the hydrogen bomb** to provide initial energy.
	- **International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)** is a collaboration of **35 nations** launched in **1985.**
		- It aims to build the **world's largest tokamak** to prove the **feasibility of fusion** as a **large-scale and carbon-free** source of energy. 
			- The **tokamak** is an experimental machine designed to harness the energy of fusion. Inside a tokamak, the energy produced through the fusion of atoms is absorbed as heat in the walls of the vessel. Like a conventional power plant, a fusion power plant uses this heat to produce steam and then electricity by way of turbines and generators.
			 ![infograph_fe.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/infograph_fe.jpg)
		- The project is based on **nuclear fusion**
		- ITER will be the **first fusion device** to maintain **fusion for long periods** of time and also **to test the integrated technologies,** materials, and physics regimes necessary for the commercial production of fusion-based electricity.
		- The ITER members include **China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States.**
		- According to the **ITER Agreement (2006),** the above mentioned seven members will share the cost of project construction, operation and decommissioning.
		- They also share the experimental results and any intellectual property generated by the fabrication, construction and operation phases.

## Nuclear energy and India
Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source in recent times. Important minerals used for the generation of nuclear energy are uranium and thorium. Uranium deposits occur in the Dharwar rocks. Geographically, uranium ores are known to occur in several locations along the **Singbhum Copper belt**.
### India's three stage nuclear programme
India’s three-stage nuclear power programme was formulated by **Homi Bhabha** in the 1950s to secure the country’s long term energy independence, through the use of **uranium** and **thorium** reserves found in the **monazite sands** of coastal regions of South India. The long-term goal of India's nuclear programme has been **to develop an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle** in meeting the country’s energy requirements.
- **Stage 1- Pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR):** The first stage involved using natural uranium to fuel PHWR to produce electricity and **Plutonium-239** as a byproduct. (**efficient reactor design - uranium enrichment not required**)
	- ==Heavy water is used as moderator and coolant.==
	- U-238-->Plutonium-239+Heat
- **Stage 2- Fast breeder reactor (FBR):** The second stage involves using plutonium-239 to produce fuel, which would be used in Fast Breeder Reactors. Plutonium 239 undergoes fission to produce energy. Once a sufficient amount of plutonium-239 is built up, thorium will be used in the reactor, to produce Uranium-233. ==This uranium is crucial for the third stage.==
	- No moderator is needed.
	- Sodium is used as coolant.
	- **In FBRs, plutonium-239 undergoes fission to produce energy, while the uranium-238 present in the fuel transmutes to additional plutonium-239.**
	- Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 can sustain a chain reaction. But Uranium-238 cannot sustain a chain reaction. So it is transmuted to Plutonium-239.
- **Stage 3- Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR):** ==The main purpose of stage-3 is to achieve a sustainable nuclear fuel cycle==.
	- The Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) has been designed to fulfill the need for the timely development of thorium-based technologies for the entire thorium fuel cycle. 
	- The Indian Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) is designed and developed to achieve large-scale use of thorium for the generation of commercial nuclear power. This reactor will produce most of its power from thorium, with no external input of uranium 233, in the equilibrium cycle.
	- The advance nuclear system would be used a combination of Uranium-233 and Thorium. This involves a self-sustaining series of **thorium-232-uranium-233** fuelled reactors.
	- India has vast thorium which would be exploited, using a thermal breeder reactor.
	- Thorium use was reserved for the last stage as despite of having significant availability, use of Thorium in production of energy has been full of certain challenges. It cannot be used directly.
	- Thorium absorbs the neutrons, which can more efficiently produce more Plutonium in Fast Breeder Reactor for a faster growth.
- Thus, the ultimate objective of the above programme is to create capacity to use Thorium for sustainable production of nuclear energy and make India energy independent.
- An alternative stage 3 is molten salt breeder reactors (MSBR), which are firming up as an option for eventual large-scale deployment.
- ![Pasted image 20230401135542.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230401135542.png)
#### Current status of India's 3 stage nuclear programme
 - After decades of operating pressurized heavy-water reactors (PHWR), ==India is finally ready to start the second stage.==
-  A 500 MW **Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam** is set to achieve criticality any day now and four more fast breeder reactors have been sanctioned, two at the same site and two elsewhere.
-  Scientists at the **Bhabha Atomic Research Centre** have successfully tested all relevant thorium-related technologies in the laboratory.
- In fact, if pressed, India could probably begin full-scale deployment of thorium reactors in ten years.
-  However, experts estimate that it would take India many more FBRs and at least another four decades before it has built up a sufficient fissile material inventory to launch the third stage.
#### Advantages of Thorium reactors
 India has very modest deposits of uranium and some of the world’s largest sources of thorium. It was keeping this in mind that in 1954, Homi Bhabha envisioned ==India’s nuclear power programme in three stages to suit the country’s resource profile.== Thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, but only a few thorium reactors have yet been completed.
- Proliferation is not easy. Weapons-grade fissionable material (U-233) is harder to retrieve safely from a thorium reactor.
- ==Thorium reactors produce far less waste than present-day reactors.==
	- Thorium produces 10 to 10,000 times less long-lived radioactive waste.
- Thorium reactors are cheaper because they have higher burn up.
- Thorium mining produces a single pure isotope, so there is no need for enrichment which reduces the cost.
- Thorium cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction without priming, so fission stops by default in an accelerator driven reactor.
#### What Hinders Deployment of Thorium-Fuelled Reactors In India?
Thorium is particularly attractive for India, as it has only around 1–2% of the global uranium reserves, but one of the **largest shares of global thorium reserves**. However, at present thorium is not economically viable because global uranium prices are much lower.
- Most people would assume that it is a limitation of technology. But instead, it is due to **shortage of uranium fuel** that is needed to **convert fertile fuel thorium into fissile** (fuel that can undergo sustained chain reaction)
	- A fissile material is one that can sustain a chain reaction upon bombardment by neutrons.
	- Thorium is by itself **fertile**, meaning that it can **transmute into a fissile radio isotope U-233** but cannot itself keep a chain reaction going.
	- In a thorium reactor, a fissile material like uranium or plutonium is blanketed by thorium.
	- The fissile material, also called a driver in this case, drives the chain reaction to produce energy while simultaneously transmuting the fertile material into fissile material.
- The obvious ==solution to India’s shortage of fissile material is to procure it from the international market.==
- **As yet, there exists no commerce in plutonium though there is no law that expressly forbids it.**
- In fact, most nuclear treaties such as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material address **only U-235 and U-233**.
- Japan and the U.K. who are looking to reduce their stockpile of plutonium will certainly be happy to sell it to India.
- The **Indo-US Nuclear Deal** and the **NSG waiver**, which ended more than three decades of international isolation of the Indian civil nuclear programme, have created many hitherto unexplored alternatives for the success of the three-stage nuclear power programme.
### Challenges associated with nuclear energy in India
- Foremost challenge of Nuclear technology is **safety and waste management**. Incidents like Chernobyl (1986), Fukushima (2011) are serious cause of concern. If nuclear energy is generated adhering to the highest standards of safety, there is less possibility of catastrophic accidents. - **Availability of fissile material** is also a cause of concern. Nuclear fuel is not available easily and ==need diplomatic efforts==.
- **Land acquisition** and selection of location for Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) is also major problem in the country. NPP’s like Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu have met with several delays due to the land acquisition related challenges.
- As India is not a signatory of NPT and NSG, nuclear supply is severely contained by sanctions against India. This situation has changed after 2009 waiver and bilateral civil nuclear energy agreements with many countries.
- Reprocessing and enrichment capacity also required boost in India. For this ==India needs advanced technology to fully utilise the spent fuel and for enhancing its enrichment capacity.==

To ensure the safety and security of using nuclear power there is need to ensure maintenance of the skills base, continued effective safety regulation. Fostering progress on facilities for waste disposal and management must be given serious consideration. It is also important to maintain and reinforce international non-proliferation arrangements.

 have also been a significant area of focus for India, with the country becoming a nuclear power in 1974. India has been promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including power generation, medicine, and agriculture.

- **Cruise Missile**: A cruise missile is an unmanned self-propelled guided vehicle (highly accurate) that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path. They can be launched from land, sea and air. They fly within the Earth’s atmosphere and use jet engine technology. Classification on the basis of speed.
	-	Subsonic cruise missile flies at a speed lesser than that of sound. It travels at a speed of around 0.8 Mach. 
	-	Supersonic cruise missile travels at a speed of around 2-3 Mach. The combination of supersonic speed and warhead mass provides high kinetic energy ensuring tremendous lethal effect.
	-	Hypersonic cruise missile travels at a speed of more than 5 Mach.
- **Fire and Forget**: It means the missile guidance does not require further guidance after the launch and still hit the target without the launcher being in line-of-sight of the target.
- **Ramjet**: A ramjet engine does not have any turbines unlike the turbojet engines. It achieves compression of intake air just by the forward speed of the air vehicle.

## Border management technologies
 A #committee under **Madhukar Gupta** (2016), was explicitly tasked to recommend technological solutions to secure the international border.
### COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED BORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CIBMS)
- It is a robust and integrated system that is capable of addressing the gaps in the present system of border security by seamlessly integrating human resources, weapons, and high-tech surveillance equipment.
- It has three main components:
	- New high-tech surveillance devices such as sensors, detectors, cameras, etc. as well as existing equipment for round-the-clock surveillance of the international border.
	- An efficient and dedicated communication network including fiber optic cables and satellite communication for transmitting data gathered; and
	- A command and control centre to which the data will be transmitted providing a composite picture of the international border.
- This would improve prevention of infiltration and smuggling attempts, cover gaps at rivers and nullahs, providing all-round security in even adverse climatic conditions & give relief to BSF troops.
## Space defence technology
- **Avatar** (Aerobic Vehicle for Transatmospheric Hypersonic Aerospace TrAnspoRtation") is a concept study for a robotic single-stage reusable space plane capable of horizontal takeoff and landing, by DRDO.
- The mission concept is for low cost military and commercial satellite space launches.
### ASAT weapon system
- It stands for Anti-Satellite Weapon System which, is used to destroy satellites. India successfully destroyed, its own Low Earth Orbit satellite in a joint venture by DRDO and ISRO called Mission Shakti. 
- ==ASAT missile can be air, sea or land-based.==
- This will create a significant deterrence vis-a-vis the position of Pakistan, India would be able to destroy an incoming Pakistani nuclear missile.
- In case of China, which is a significant space power, counter-space capabilities of India will provide a critical balancing deterrent.
- In the times of the [[Cold War\|Cold War]], the US, and USSR had used A-SAT. Also, China in 2007, has used its A-SAT. No country has used an A-SAT against any other nation.
#### ASAT test
- Recently, India tested its first anti-satellite (ASAT) missile as part of ‘Mission Shakti’ against a previously launched live satellite. 
- An anti-satellite weapon is anything that destroys or physically damages a satellite for strategic military purposes. 
- Only the United States, Russia, China, and now India have demonstrated this capability successfully. 
- Mission Shakti is India’s response to the potent case of future weaponisation of space, where enemy nation can indulge in space war to disrupt critical infrastructure of the nation.
#### Significance of mission Shakti
1. India’s entry in the elite group of 4 countries.
2. Entire effort is indigenous.
3. Addressed the concerns of Space Debris. DRDO has said that all the debris of India’s ASAT will decay in 45 days.
4. Develops credible deterrence during war. The anti-satellite space technology shows India’s focus on security challenges, emanating beyond Pakistan.
5. Test done before any kind of international sanctions come in place as UN General Assembly is trying to bring about an international legally binding document on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.
6. Did not invite international criticism and won’t impact other strategic interests.
## Other defence related technologies
- **THERMOBARIC BOMB**: Thermobaric bomb uses oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature blast wave that packs an incredible amount of energy into a small, localised area.
	- US recently dropped GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB)  bomb popularly called the **Mother of All Bombs** on Afghanistan. It is a Thermobaric bomb
	- Russia also possesses Thermobaric bomb, popularly known as **Father of All Bombs** which is four times more powerful than the U.S. weapon.
- **Hydrogen Bombs**: Hydrogen bombs are thermonuclear weapons which employs fusion of isotopes of hydrogen. 
	- The energy released in a Hydrogen bomb is several magnitudes higher than an Atom bomb. 
	- A fusion bomb is more sophisticated and difficult to make, since it requires a much higher temperature - in the order of millions of degrees centigrade. So a fission is carried out first to produce more energy, which is then used to initiate fusion.
- **Atomic Bombs**: Atomic bombs differ from hydrogen bombs primarily due to the fact they are fission bombs. 
	- It develops its energy from the fission of heavy, unstable nuclei. Radioactive forms of elements such as plutonium and uranium are especially susceptible to fission. In fission reactions, heavy nucleus breaks up when it is bombarded with neutrons. The reaction that follows also releases neutrons along with two lighter nuclei. These 2 nuclei are then bombarded with the neutrons generate making it a chain reaction.
- **LASER WEAPONS SYSTEM (LAWS)**: Laws is world’s first laser weapon, launched by USA.
	- It releases photons at the speed of light silently hitting their target and burning it to a temperature of thousands of degrees. It is completely invisible.
- **Chemical weapons**: A chemical weapon is any toxic chemical that can cause death, injury, incapacitation, and sensory irritation, deployed via a delivery system, such as an artillery shell, rocket, or ballistic missile.
	- Chemical weapons are considered weapons of mass destruction and their use in armed conflict is a violation of international law.
	- Primary forms of chemical weapons include nerve agents (sarin, soman, VX, Novichok), blister agents or Vesicants (mustard and lewisite), choking agents (chlorine and phosgene), and blood agents (hydrogen cyanide).
- Biological weapons are one among the three types of weapon of mass destruction (WMD) - Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) 1972.
- Zorawar indigenous Indian light tank to be deployed across LAC.

# ISSUES RELATING TO IPR
> Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect (inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names and images used in commerce). Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. 
> >Intellectual property rights include patents, copyright, industrial design rights, trademarks, plant variety rights, trade dress, geographical indications, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.

Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility. The issue still remains open in legal scholarship. 
## Significance of IPRs
- IPRs allows people and business to protect their ideas and prevent copying.
- IPRs gives **economic incentive** for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create.
	- In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, an average expenditure of more than $231 million is required to discover, test, and secure marketing approval for a new drug in the United States (Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, 1992). To recoup such substantial investments, a company must be able to market the resulting products globally, which makes the worldwide intellectual property protection critical.
- Stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries.
- Government  can use IPRs to encourage industrial development and economic growth.
- Ensure [[Ease of doing business\|Ease of doing business]]
- It **facilitates the transfer of technology** in the form of foreign direct investment, joint ventures and licensing.
- IPRs also helps to stimulate and ensure fair competition and to protect consumers, by enabling them to make informed choices between various goods and services.
## Types of IPRs
### Patent
>Patent is given for an invention which is a new product or process that is novel, non-obvious and have some industrial use.
- Patents in India are governed by **The Patents Act, 1970** which was amended in 2005.
- Given for 20 years.  
- Patents help innovators to recoup amounts invested by them.
- The right to monopolise production will act as an incentive to innovate.
### Copyright
>A copyright gives the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or "works". Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.

- The Copyright Act, 1957 protects original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and cinematograph films and sound recordings from unauthorized uses.
### Trademark
>Trademarks distinguish the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings.
### Industrial design rights
>An industrial design right (sometimes called "design right" or design patent) protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. design is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.
- Designs India are governed by "**The Designs Act, 2000**"
### Plant variety right
>Plant breeders' rights or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered. 
- Plant variety protection in India is governed by "**The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPV&FR) Act, 2001**". e.g. Potato farmers sued by PepsiCo ₹1.05 crore each as damages for ‘infringing its rights’ by growing the potato variety used in its Lays chips. Farmers won the case.
	- India revoked PepsiCo's patent in 2021

### Trade secrets
>A trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g. Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)
### Semiconductor integrated circuit layout-design
- For innovation in integrated circuit layout-design.
- Governed by Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Layout-Design Act, 2000.
### Geographic indications (GIs)
>Geographical indications refer to goods as originating in a specific geographical region. So, the characteristics, qualities or reputation  thereof essentially attributable to such region. e.g. Scotch Whiskey from Scotland, Darjeeling tea etc.
- Given for a period of 10 years.
#### Potential of Geographical Indications
- GIs support and protect local production. They help us in generating local employment and are mostly untouched by industrialisation, originating in villages or small towns.
- Since consistent quality is a must in GI-branded goods, producers are expected to diligently follow specific production methods which leads to better quality control.
- Many European GIs have also successfully built up ancillary industries like tourism and lodging in the respective regions.
- ==GIs can boost our exports.==
- GI-branded goods can be made 100 percent in India without the need for any foreign direct investment (FDI) and that they can promote socio-economic development of the respective regions. 
- GIs are perhaps the most ideal IP rights to foster and realise a programme like Make in India.
#### Measures needed to strengthen GI
- Current Indian legal framework for GIs needs to be strengthened to address quality control and consumer expectations by insisting on multi-layered quality control systems as a precondition for registration.
- Give a competitive advantage to producers and enable consumers to make more informed choices by providing clear information on origin specific products and their characteristics.
- Important issues faced by GI producer bodies like market access and funding for enforcement and marketing need to be addressed.
- Correcting the definition of producer under the GI Act, which is currently ambiguous and can mean either local manufacturer, retailer or dealer.
- Still a greenhorn in GI protection, India must hand hold producer bodies, look at successful models elsewhere and mould these to suit the ground realities of protection and enforcement in a developing country.

## India and IPR
- India is a member of the [[World Trade Organisation (WTO)\|World Trade Organisation (WTO)]] and committed to the Agreement on [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TOC#Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights TRIPS\|Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property]] (TRIPS Agreement).
- India is also a member of **World Intellectual Property Organization**, a body responsible for the promotion of the protection of intellectual property rights throughout the world.
- India is a signatory to the following WIPO-administered International Treaties and Conventions relating to IPRs:
	- Budapest Treaty which deals with the International Recognition of the Deposit of Micro-organisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure
  - Paris Convention (the Protection of Industrial Property)
  - Berne Convention working in the field of the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
  - Patent Cooperation Treaty
	- Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement (the International Registration of Marks- Madrid Protocol)
	- Washington Treaty (for Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits)
	- Nairobi Treaty (the Protection of the Olympic Symbol)
	- Marrakesh Treaty which Facilitates Access to the published work to Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities
	- IN 2019, the Union Cabinet approved the proposal for Accession of India to the ==Nice, Vienna and Locarno Agreements, related to the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) international classification systems.==
	- Ratified Nagoya protocol of CBD - fair and Equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources.
### IPR Regime in India
India is continuing to improve its global ranking in the **Global Innovation Index (GII) issued by WIPO** ( #index). In the last years’ global innovation index, we improved four places to 46th (2021). Improved from 81st in 2015 to 52nd place in 2019, 48th in 2020.
#### Reasons for improvement India’s IP regime
- Accession to IPR related international treaties, e.g. India accession to WIPO Performances and phonograms treaty.
- Consent to initiate a Patent prosecution Highway (set of initiatives for providing accelerated patent prosecution procedures by sharing information between some patent offices) with international offices.
- Dedicated set of IP incentives for small business enterprises. e.g. GI tags given to Alphonse Mangoes, Nilambur teak etc.
- A strong awareness raising effort on the negative impact of piracy and counterfeiting. e.g. **Mascot IP Nani by Ministry of Commerce and Industry** is a tech-savvy grandmother who helps the government and enforcement agencies in combating IP crimes.
- To encourage for innovation and seek protection for their inventions, a 50 percent fee reduction has been provided.
- Filing of patents and trademarks applications has been made online.
- Almost all old Intellectual Property (IP) records have been digitised and new records are digitized immediately.
- Automated electronic modules have been adopted to process Patents and Trademarks applications which enabled achieving enhanced speed, accuracy and transparency.
- IP office has been transformed to enhance efficiency in processing of applications, uniformity and consistency in the examination of applications, bilateral cooperation at the international level, and raising awareness level of public.
- To increase transparency and dissemination of information, the real time status of IP applications and e-registers is now open to the public MSMEs.
#### National IPR Policy 2016
##### Features of IPR policy, 2016
- Establishment of cell for to function under the [[Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)\|DPIIT]] for creation and Commercialisation of IP assets. State level cells to be created to prevent IPR thefts.
- Legal and Legislative framework to have strong and effective IPR laws, which balance the interests of rights owners with larger public interest. Administration and implementation of IP related laws brought under [[Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)\|DPIIT]].
- Major national institutes to make IPR studies compulsory.
- IPR awareness to create public awareness about the economic, social and cultural benefits of IPRs among all sections of society.
- Commercialisation of IPR to get value for IPRs through commercialization.
- Enhancing access to health care, food security and environment by leveraging IP. Human Capital Development to strengthen and expand human resources, institutions and capacities for teaching, training, research and skill building in IPRs.
##### Significance
- Proposed cell would create a single window system for promotion, awareness and utilisation of IP in the country.
- It will create conducive environment for R&D which will enhance creativity and innovation of indigenous products like medicines. It will facilitate a stable, transparent and service oriented IPR administration in the country.
- The policy needs to be commended for taking note of our informal economy and the need to encourage the creativity found within.
- The policy recommends that the un-authorised copying of movies be criminalised.
- It will increase awareness on IPR in India and its about economical, social and cultural benefits by strengthening and expanding human resources.
##### Criticism
- The entire edifice of the present IP policy is built on this flawed foundation equating more IP with more innovation. IP could accelerate innovation in some sectors while it impedes innovation in others.
- The policy also ignores the fact that at present, a large number of patents are owned by foreigners and, therefore, any easing of rules for patent protection would benefit them much more than domestic applicants.
- The policy advocates that publicly funded scientists and professors must convert all of their discoveries into IP assets. Elon Musk dedicated inventions to public which helped in the growth of automobile industry. Scientists like Benjamin Franklin and J.C. Bose shunned patents owing to their potential to curb the free flow of knowledge.
- Time cost of IP registrations exceeds royalties.
- No doubt films require some protection from pirates, but criminalising of what is essentially a civil wrong is an over reaction.
- The policy proposes to convert each piece of our [[Traditional Knowledge\|Traditional Knowledge]] into an IP asset. We must first study whether GI resulted in substantial benefits to any community.
#### Other initiatives taken
- The NCERT curriculum (Commerce stream) has included IPRs in its subjects.
- Many **Technology and Innovation Support Centres (TISCs)** have been formed in various institutions in the country.
- [[Atal Innovation Mission\|Atal Innovation Mission]]
- **India Innovation Index**, jointly developed by [[NITI Aayog\|NITI Aayog]], CII and [[Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)\|Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)]] in consultation with [[World Economic Forum\|World Economic Forum]] and others. #index

- IMPRINT #scheme
- NIDHI (National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations), an umbrella program is pioneered by the Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India, for nurturing ideas and innovations (knowledge-based and technology-driven) into successful startups.
##### The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)
- TKDL involves documentation and digitization of the [[Traditional Knowledge\|Traditional Knowledge]] available in public domain from the literature related to Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha, in five international languages- English, French, German, Spanish and Japanese.
- ==TKDL is an effective deterrent against biopiracy and is recognized as a global leader in the area of [[Traditional Knowledge\|Traditional Knowledge]] protection.==
- TKDL is a digital project between-
	- Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
	- Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
	- Ministry of Science and Technology and
	- Department of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy ([[Traditional Medicines\|AYUSH]]).
- Effectiveness
	- India Foiled Colgate-Palmolive bid to Patent Nutmeg Mouthwash.
	- India won the Patent war on hair loss formula against Pangaea Laboratories Limited, a UK based company.
	- Over 1500 yoga asanas are shortlisted to thwart patenting by foreign parties.
	- JNTGBRI won a patent for traditional polyherbal formulation, which has many therapeutic properties - headed by a traditional healer from Kerala-Innovative step in the protection of [[Traditional Knowledge\|Traditional Knowledge]] and equitable sharing of benefits.
##### KAPILA Kalam Campaign
- KAPILA is an acronym for Kalam Program for IP (Intellectual Property) Literacy and Awareness.
- Through the KAPILA Kalam Program, Government of India will spread the awareness and importance of patenting and inventions.
- Under this campaign, students pursuing education in higher educational institutions will get information about the correct system of the application process for patenting their invention and they will be aware of their rights.
- The program will facilitate the colleges and institutions to encourage more and more students to file patents.
#### India and shortage of cheap life saving drugs
##### Generic drugs
- A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that contains the same chemical substance as a drug that was originally protected by patents.
- Generic drugs are allowed for sale after the patents on the original drugs expire.
- Because the active chemical substance is the same, the medical profile of generics is believed to be equivalent in performance.
- A generic drug has the same **active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)** as the original, but it may differ in some characteristics such as the manufacturing process, formulation, excipients, color, taste, and packaging.
##### Issues with generic drugs
- The main concern is to offer the best medicines which are most effective so medical professionals should not be forced to prescribe in a particular manner.
- The government has to ensure easy availability, unclogged supply chain, and strict quality control of generic medicines.
- It also has to ensure availability and effectiveness also of generic medicines.
- Awareness about generic drugs is low among people. They are generally perceived as inferior in quality.
##### Way forward
- A legal framework for quality testing
- Awareness generation
- Public R&D
- Supply of generic and affordable medicines through **Jan Aushadi Kendra**
- The government should keep strict price control on medicines and ensure that the highest quality medicines are given to the patients.
- All laws, checks and balances should be directed at giving the best possible treatment at the best cost.
- Economist Joseph Stiglitz proposed a prize fund for medical research in place of patents, out of public money.
#### Existing flaws in India's IPR regime
- Processing delay due to lack of sufficient workforce at the level of assistant registrar and above.
- **Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act 1970 (as amended in 2005)** does not allow patent to be granted to inventions involving new forms of a known substance unless it differs significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.  
	- This means that the Indian Patent Act **does not allow evergreening of patents**.
	- This has been a cause of concern to the pharma companies. Section 3(d) was instrumental in the Indian Patent Office (IPO) **rejecting the patent for Novartis’ drug Glivec** (imatinib mesylate).
- **Issue of Compulsory licencing (CL):** CL is problematic for foreign investors who bring technology as they are concerned about the misuse of CL to replicate their products. It has been impacting [[India-EU\|India-EU]] FTA negotiations.  
	- CL is the **grant of permission by the government to entities** to use, manufacture, import or sell a patented invention without the patent-owner’s consent. ==Patents Act in India deals with CL==.
	- CL is **permitted under the WTO’s TRIPS (IPR) Agreement** provided conditions such as ==‘national emergencies, other circumstances of extreme urgency and anti-competitive practices’ are fulfilled==.
- India continues to remain on the United States Trade Representative's (USTR’s) **‘Priority Watch List’** for alleged **violations of intellectual property rights (IPR)**.  
	- In its latest **Special 301 report** released by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the US termed India as “one of the world’s most challenging major economies" with respect to protection and enforcement of IP.
- **Data Exclusivity:** Foreign investors and MNCs allege that Indian law does not protect against unfair commercial use of test data or other data submitted to the government during the application for market approval of pharmaceutical or agro-chemical products. For this they demand a **Data Exclusivity law**.
	- Data exclusivity protects data generated in the course of clinical trials of a drug. The USA insists on having Data Exclusivity in its trade deals. It offers much better protection of data to the manufacturer of drugs. 
- **Enforcement of the Copyright act is weak,** and piracy of copyrighted materials is widespread.
- ==[[Traditional Knowledge\|Traditional Knowledge]] is ignored==. This resulted in multiple cases of Biopiracy - (e.g. Neem, Turmeric plant, Basmati Rice)
	- Biopiracy: the practice of commercially exploiting naturally occurring biochemical or genetic material, especially by obtaining patents that restrict its future use, while failing to pay fair compensation to the community from which it originates.
## Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
- TRIPS is an international agreement on intellectual property rights.
- The Agreement covers most forms of intellectual property including patents, copyright, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, trade secrets, & exclusionary rights over new plant varieties.
- It came into force in 1995 & is binding on all members of the [[World Trade Organisation (WTO)\|World Trade Organisation (WTO)]].
### Recent developments
- India and South Africa requested for #COVID-19 related TRIPS waiver to facilitate the production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics around the world.
- The core idea is that IPRs such as patents should not become a barrier in scaling up production of medical products to combat COVID-19. But many are of the view that an IP waiver would hamper Innovation and technology of developed world.
- **The Doha declaration on TRIPS flexibilities** permits compulsory licensing in a public health emergency.
	- Compulsory licensing override  patent rights to allow local production or import of drugs by generic manufacturres in the event of a public health crisis.
- Issuing of compulsory licenses for COVID-19 vaccines in the absence of technology transfer may not yield the expected results. some experts suggests using the Voluntary License (VL) provision could yield better results.
	- **Voluntary License**- A patent holder decides to license a product to other producers. (Usually accompanied by  "technology transfer") The patent companies would be paid a royalty by licensee. This provision was used extensively to produce AIDS drugs in the low-income countries. This method also comes with better public relations.
	- Legal experts say, patents are not iron clad ownership rights. They are a temporary contract that balances the public interest with the claims of the innovator.

## Arguments against IPR
- IPRs arguably raise the cost of the new technology and restrict its availability. e.g. #COVID-19 vaccines. This may, in turn, retard further progress in the technology by preventing other firms from developing new innovations or improvements that build on the original innovation in a cumulative way. 
- If the new technology has productivity-enhancing effects when used in economic activity, these too may be retarded by the protection of the original innovation.
- The idea that patents are the only means available to promote innovation has become something of a dogma.
- The foreign corporations use patents to suppress competition from Indian entities, and thus, **medicines were priced at exorbitant rates**. (found by a ** #committee chaired by Justice N. Rajagopala Ayyangar** in 1959)
## Way forward
- The IPR policy must be backed up with strong research and development infrastructure and the environment.
- The issue of openness, sharing, and access to knowledge should be addressed as early as possible.
- The innovation ecosystem including the **[[Atal Innovation Mission\|Atal Innovation Mission]]**, Start-up India must be carried forward.
- The skilled manpower shortage for administrative work of the IPR regime must be improved.
- The awareness generation should go beyond formal institutions like schools and colleges. A lot of innovation happens in the rural and tribal sectors. They must be educated.
- Special courts for IPR adjudications must be set up in important innovation hubs.
- India must take a consistent stand on IPRs on #COVID-19 medical products internationally and domestically.

A strong IPR regime can transform India into a creative and innovative society. IPR regime must be carefully regulated to ensure that the benefit of IPR accrues to Indian society rather than to west.

 (intellectual property rights) have been a major concern in India's S&T sector. The country has been grappling with issues of patent protection, copyright infringement, and piracy, which have hindered innovation and economic growth.

[[Gender inequality#Gender inequality in Science and technology\|Gender inequality in Science and technology]] remains a significant challenge in India. Women continue to be underrepresented in the S&T sector, with limited access to education, training, and employment opportunities. Addressing gender inequality in S&T is critical to promoting inclusivity and diversity in the sector.

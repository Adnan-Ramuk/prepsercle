### Rohingyan issue 
- Rohingya came to Myanmar in the 19th century when the British ruled all of what is now India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.
- In 1982, the Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship by the government of Myanmar.
- They are mostly Muslim people who live in northern Rakhine (Arakan) of Myanmar & are one of the most persecuted minority groups according to the UN.
- The Rohingyan conflict is one of the longest conflicts between the majority Buddhist Burmese and the minority Muslims in Myanmar.
- In 2015 a refugee crisis involving the Rohingyas spread panic across the region, after boats carrying hundreds of refugees were found floating in the sea. Many of these refugees also fled to India. There are an estimated 40,000 Rohingya refugees presently located in India. For India, the Rohingya problem is made further significant by the fact that many of them occupy Rakhine province – home to Sitwe.
- Suu Kyi has thus far been reluctant to make direct and open commitments toward the resolution of the Rohingya crisis, fearing a possible political backlash at home. 
#### Solution for Rohingyan issue.
- Asylum bill bought by Shashi Tharoor – to deal with refugee problem. We deal with refugee issue in case by case format. In case of Tibetan refuges - we gave them certificates. In case of Sri Lankan Tamils, we give them tag of camp refugees and non-camp refugees.
- We are not ready to give refugee status to Rohingyas because of security reasons. As there is a worry of terror outfits using these vulnerable people and certain news of ISIS making inroads among them.
- However, we are ready to give them supporting by giving aid to Bangladesh, where they are camped now. We have also asked Myanmar to stop persecution. 
- We cannot deport close to 40,000 Myanmar refugees present here as they do not have citizenship of any country.
## Way forward
- Economic cooperation should be increased under frameworks like BIMSTEC AND MGCI (Initiative to increase cooperation in transportation and communication culture and tourism and education) - Will increase track 2 diplomacy
- Trade - important to increase commodity basket
- 5B’s - [[Buddhism\|Buddhism]]+ Business + Bollywood + Bharatanatyam + Burma Teak
- Improve border infrastructure
- Timely completion of various connectivity projects is the need of the hour.
- Focus on multilateralism - BIMSTEC, MGCI, ASEAN, SASEC
- Counter China through India's soft power.
- New Delhi should help to strengthen democratic institutions in Myanmar.
- Cooperation in counter insurgency activities can further cement the relationship.

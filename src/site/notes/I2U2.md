## Potential of I2U2
- **Aid to India’s West Asian policy**: The [[Abraham Accords\|Abraham Accords]] will allow India to enhance its relationship with Israel without endangering its relations with the UAE and other Arab nations.
- **Boost to trade and connectivity:** I2U2 can give a boost to trade and connectivity among the partners.
- **Investment to India:** The platform is important for drawing investors and companies from West Asia to India's sizable consumer market.
- **Cooperation in technology:** could strengthen the start-up ecosystems in India and Israel.
- **Food Security:** These nations can collaborate to lessen the effects of food shortage problems in the domain of food security.
- **Containment of China:** The newly formed alliance will boost US efforts to contain Chinese influence in Asia and the Middle East.

## Challenges
- **Israel-Palestine conflict:** is preventing other Arab countries from joining the alliance.
- **Internal issues within the Arab nations:** are also challenged by the grouping’s smooth conduct. E.g., Shia-Sunni conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
- **Expanding Chinese presence in the West Asian region:** another point India and the US will want to counter.

>If what is on paper can be realised, the I2U2 group has the potential to be a "game changer" in India's foreign policy. #conclusion

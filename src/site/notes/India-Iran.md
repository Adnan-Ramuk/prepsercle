# India-Iran
India-Iran relations encompass economic, strategic, and cultural dimensions, influenced heavily by regional dynamics and global geopolitics. The complexities include India’s energy needs, Iran’s sanctions-ridden economy, regional security challenges, and the interests of other influential nations like the U.S. and Israel.
### Key Issues and Developments

1. **Farzad B Gas Field**: India's ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) discovered the Farzad B gas field in Iran in 2000, containing an estimated 23 trillion cubic feet of gas. However, due to U.S. sanctions on Iran and prolonged negotiations, Iran ultimately decided to develop the field domestically, marking a setback for India’s energy interests in the region.
    
2. **Sanctions and Trade Decline**: U.S. sanctions have severely impacted India-Iran bilateral trade, reducing it from $17 billion to $2 billion within a short period. Sanctions restrict India's ability to pay Iran in dollars, leading to a significant reduction in oil imports, which were once a major component of the trade relationship. This drop has affected India’s energy security and trade relations, as Iran had previously offered favorable terms.
    
3. **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)**: India and Iran are collaborating on the INSTC, which seeks to connect India to Russia and Central Asia via Iran, bypassing Pakistan. This corridor has significant geopolitical implications, providing India with a more efficient trade route and reducing its reliance on maritime routes dominated by China. However, its progress has been delayed due to sanctions and regional instability.

### Political and Economic Implications of the Indo-Iran Gas Pipeline (PYMQ 2005)

The proposed Indo-Iran gas pipeline, which was conceived to transport natural gas from Iran to India via Pakistan, faced numerous political and economic challenges:

- **Economic Implications**: The pipeline would have provided India with a stable and affordable supply of natural gas, supporting its growing energy demands. Additionally, it could have helped diversify India's energy sources, reducing dependence on other oil-exporting nations.
    
- **Political Implications**: The pipeline route through Pakistan raised security concerns for India, given the volatile nature of Indo-Pakistan relations. There was also significant opposition from the U.S., which viewed the pipeline as potentially strengthening Iran’s economy and undermining its sanction regime. Consequently, political concerns largely stalled the project, and India eventually withdrew.

### Impact of U.S. Sanctions on India-Iran Relations (PYMQ 2012)

U.S. sanctions on Iran have created multiple challenges for India-Iran relations:

- **Energy Trade**: Sanctions curtailed India's crude oil imports from Iran, forcing India to seek alternative sources. Iran previously offered favorable terms, including discounts and payment flexibility in rupees, which India lost due to reduced trade with Iran. Additionally, sanctions limited India's investments in Iranian energy projects like Farzad B.
    
- **Strategic Connectivity**: Sanctions have also slowed India’s infrastructure investments in Iran, particularly the Chabahar Port, which India views as a strategic alternative to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia. Though the U.S. initially exempted Chabahar from sanctions, the overall geopolitical environment affected the project's pace and financing options.
    
- **Regional Balance**: U.S. sanctions have forced India to balance its relationship with Iran and its strategic partnership with the U.S. India has had to navigate diplomatically to maintain good relations with both countries, especially considering the U.S.’s stance on Iran’s nuclear program.

### Iran-Israel Conflict and the Regional Impact

Iran and Israel’s rivalry is increasingly visible in Syria, where Iran supports the Assad regime and Israel seeks to counter Iranian influence. This conflict complicates India’s position in West Asia, as it maintains strong ties with Israel while balancing its relations with Iran. India's neutral stance and focus on economic and strategic interests help it manage these relationships, although regional instability remains a concern.

### Iran Nuclear Pact and the JCPOA

The **Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)**, or Iran Nuclear Deal, was signed in 2015 to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for sanction relief. The U.S.’s 2018 withdrawal from the JCPOA and subsequent re-imposition of sanctions strained India-Iran ties, limiting economic opportunities. India supports a return to the JCPOA framework as it would allow renewed trade with Iran, enhancing regional stability and providing more options for energy imports.
- Iran to develop **Farzad B gas field** domestically.  India's OVL (ONGC Videsh Ltd) had discovered the gas field in 2000.
- Sanctions resulted in huge drop in India-Iran bilateral trade from $17 billion to $2billion in less than 10 months.

- Iran was then estimated to be months away from accumulating enough highly enriched Uranium to produce one nuclear device.
- Trump adopted a policy of Maximum Pressure to coerce Iran back to the negotiating table.
- When the sanctions began to hurt , Tehran shifted to a strategy of 'maximum resistance'

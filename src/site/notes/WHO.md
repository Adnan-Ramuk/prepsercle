# WHO
- WHO was severely criticised for its poor handling of the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Incontrovertibly, the relevance of the health agency has been fading. The WHO has been reduced to a coordinating body, beholden to the interests of rich member states. 
- WHO had launched Access to #COVID-19 Tools (ACT) accelerator programme, whose vaccine arm is called COVAX. WHO NEEDED AT LEAST $100 BILLION FOR THIS PROGRAM. FACES THE ISSUE OF FUND SHORTAGE.
- WHO declared monkey-pox as PHEIC - Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

# India-Afghanistan
![Pasted image 20210729225421.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210729225421.png)

## India’s Presence In Afghanistan
- Barring a brief pause in the 1990s, India has historically enjoyed good ties with Afghanistan, which go back to the 1950 Treaty of Friendship.
- Indian interests and influence suffered when the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, captured Kabul in 1996.
- But India was back in action as soon as the Taliban were ousted from power after the US invasion in 2001.
- India has made huge investments and commitments ever since, which run into over USD 3 billion, and cultivated strong economic and defence ties with the Afghan government.
## Afghan Peace Process
![Pasted image 20220910114114.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220910114114.png)
### Developments before Taliban's takeover
- After 9/11 attack in 2001, US declared war on Afghanistan.
- Despite the Doha agreement Taliban has not ended it ties with al-Qaeda and other similar terrorist groups.
- US is advocating for 'a new, inclusive government ' in Afghanistan which implies 50% power sharing with Taliban as a *quid pro quo* for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.
- India remains fully committed to Afghanistan, bilateral relations are flourishing.
- Some experts are of the view that If U.S forces are pulled out, India must step up to assist materially those who want defend Afghan republic. 
- Pakistan played a double game by joining America's war on terror on hand and helping Taliban to capture territory and provided shelter to terrorists on the other.
- Pakistan wants to check on India's engagement in Afghan. Pak wants a peaceful settlement and transfer of power this time.
- Afghan government is critical of USA's direct outreach to Taliban. Afghan President has already opposed any transfer of power except through elections.
- US has withdrawn since it realized that the war is unwinnable. Ever since its withdrawal Taliban is capturing more territory.
- Intra-Afghan peace process is frozen.
- If U.S withdraw its troops without a peace mechanism, Taliban could make rapid territorial gains.
- India signed an agreement to build the Shahtoot dam near Kabul.
- India should strive for 'double peace', both inside Afghanistan and in the region.
- The U.S is estimated to spent more than $2 trillion in Afghan over the past two decades.
- Defeating the Taliban and nation-building were part of the **neoconservative ideology** (promotion of democracy and interventionism in international affairs) of the US, which has evidently failed.
- However, the US can abandon the Afghan government and exit the theatre, but India cannot. It has to protect its investments, prevent Afghanistan from becoming another safe haven for anti-India terrorist groups, and also check Pakistan deepening its influence in Kabul.
### Post Taliban takeover
- Being the Taliban's chief patron; Pakistan is the most important player in the Afghan conflict. Taliban also draw support from regional players including Russia, China and Iran.
- New Delhi remains a peripheral player. 
- United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)
- Turkey to secure Kabul airport after U.S withdrawal. 
- Troika of the US, China and Russia have kept India out of the leading role in Afghan. Troika plus - China, U.S, Russia and Pakistan
- New quad group (diplomatic platform) to focus on regional connectivity - US, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Uzbekistan.
- The average years of education received by Afghan women is 1.4.
- India started reaching out with Taliban - Since Taliban would play a critical role in Afghanistan in the coming years.

## Post-American Afghanistan
- >The proposed withdrawal of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from Afghanistan in 2014 is fraught with major security implications for the countries of the region. Examine in light of the fact that India is faced with a plethora of challenges and needs to safeguard its own strategic interests. #PYMQ 2013
- Dilemma is how to offer structured incentives to the Taliban and when. For India it is whether to engage with Taliban or not.
- Pakistan wants to India to keep India away from Kabul. If India engage with Taliban, Pakistan might put more pressure on Kashmir.
- Only 2% of Afghanistan's 38 million people have enough food, according to the [[World Food Programme\|World Food Programme]]. Nearly every Afghan citizen could be living in poverty by mid-2022
- The UN mission should start engaging with Taliban.
## Challenges for India
### China factor
- Chinese firms eye Afghanistan's Lithium deposits with Taliban nod.
- Extension of CPEC to Afghanistan.

# Role of external state and non state actors in creating challenges to internal security
India, has had to deal with several security threats to its internal security from external state and non-state actors. These actors often play a crucial role in creating and exacerbating the internal security challenges that India faces.

>State actors refer to those **entities which have formal backing of a sovereign state** for carrying out any intended action. Examples of state actors are the army, bureaucracy, intelligence agencies etc. #definition 

>Non-state actors are individuals or organisations that have economic, political or social power but do not belong to any particular country or state. They include NGOs, MNCs, religious outfits, Mafias, terrorist groups etc. They may work in tandem for the peace, stability and development of a country or they may work against the state. #definition 

Both state and non-state factors from outside have created problems in our internal security framework. Hence while it is imperative to guard our borders and strengthen our diplomacy, on the other hand, we need to check the various non state actors who come in hidden forms.
## External state actors
- Countries surrounding India have been actively exploiting the volatile situation presented by the turmoil in the northeast. 
	- Not only countries such as China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, but also smaller powers such as Bhutan and Nepal have been involved in the region.
	- Insurgency:
		- North-East suffers from violent movements based upon ethnic identities leading to clashes. China is alleged to support such acts for instance. United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) members of Assam were given shelter by China.
- The state may carry out a limited war against Indian state and this might have ramifications for our internal security.
	- There have been instances where state actors have been responsible for carrying out a limited cyber warfare through hacking and other espionage. e.g. 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



 - Chinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. e.g. Power outrage in Mumbai, October 2020 due to cyber attack. 

</div></div>

- Influencing India's internal politics: Use of propaganda and disinformation campaigns to influence public opinion and create unrest. This has become a significant concern for India in recent years, given the increasing use of social media and the spread of fake news.
	- 50 percent of tweets in connection with the case of violence at Koregaon-Bhima in Maharashtra in 2018 originated from Pakistan.
	- They might support the various insurgent groups, Naxalites, or separatist groups through funding, training or logistics which might pose a threat to our internal security. e.g. Pakistan’s ISI.
- Terrorism: Countries such as Pakistan have been accused of providing support to terrorist organizations that operate in India, and have been alleged to fund and train these groups. 

>Through political backing, economic assistance, logistic support, military training or arms supplies, external state actors have varyingly contributed to the internal security challenges in the country. 
## Non-state actors
- Non-state actors from the neighbouring country have been carrying out a proxy war since decades in order to bleed India to death. e.g. Jihadis
- Certain NGOs and so called civil society organizations also work in a **clandestine manner** to provoke discontent sections of Indian society which creates internal security issues. e.g. Protests against nuclear plants.
	- They can also incite people for [[Regionalism\|regionalism]] thus demanding their separate state which further increases secessionist tendency.
	- Support for Khalistan movement from countries like UK and Canada
- Various dubious non-state actors run fake currency rackets which pose a challenge to the economic security of India.
	- It corrodes economy from inside, by facilitating black money and money laundering activities as well as funding terrorism, which itself creates a demand for fake currency, thereby creating a positive feedback loop. This is the issue arising especially from Pakistan.
- Various organised crime syndicates have been running drug rackets which also create internal security issues through the illicit flow of money.
- Non state actor-sponsored terrorism, often motivated by fundamentalist ideologies, backed by secretive but efficient financial networks, use of IT, clandestine access to chemical-biological and nuclear materials, and illicit drug trafficking, has emerged as a major threat to international stability.
	- Non-state actors like terrorist groups for instance Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad are a continuous threat.
	- Transnational terror networks such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have attempted to radicalize Indian youth and have used social media to spread their ideology.
	- These groups aim to not only create instability in states like J&K, they also have a larger aim of destabilising the country. This is done through sporadic terrorist strikes, which spreads terror and panic. This could also adversely affect the ability of the Indian state to pursue economic modernisation.
- Drug trafficking
	- Inter and Intra state trafficking takes place, through golden crescent and golden triangle routes.
	- Drugs from Golden Crescent (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) have affected Punjab and Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar and Thailand) has affected North Eastern states.
- Human-trafficking:
	- Children and women trafficking takes place via Bangladesh and Nepal.
- [[GS 1/SOCIETY/Communalism\|Communalism]]
	- Propagandas are run and funded by enemy country and other non-state actors (NGOs and CSOs) to destabilize India by damaging the socio-religious fabric and ensure riots.
- Cyber Security
	- Recent cyber-attacks by Legion, ATM skimming are examples. Pakistani hackers often hack government websites.

>The role of external state and non-state actors in creating challenges to internal security in India is significant. India needs to take a comprehensive approach to deal with these threats, including strengthening its border security, enhancing its counter-terrorism capabilities, and working with its international partners to tackle these issues. #conclusion 

## Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan & Security of India
The Taliban’s return to power has caused a major diplomatic setback for India, it now being one of the region’s “most disadvantaged” players.
### Challenges for India
- Indian interests in Afghan: The key concern and challenge is the protection of the investment that India has made in Afghanistan. The challenges range from securing its development infrastructures to safely evacuating Indians stranded in troubled Afghanistan.
- Pakistan’s destabilizing role in Afghanistan: Pakistan sees Afghanistan as potentially providing strategic depth against India. 
- Spread of International Terrorism: For India, a bigger challenge will be about the Taliban’s renewed support for international terrorism and Pakistan’s re-direction of jihadi groups that have allegedly fought with the Taliban towards India. Presence of other groups like ISIS and Haqqani Network and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP).
- Religious Fundamentalism: Like all radical groups, the Taliban will have trouble balancing its religious ideology with the imperatives of state interests. India faces a challenge to deradicalise the region for long lasting peace and stability. It might increase the [[Radicalisation\|radicalisation]] tendencies in J&K and PoK regions.
- New Regional Geopolitical Developments: There can be new regional geopolitical alignments (such as China-Pakistan-Taliban) which may go against the interests of India.
- Organised crimes: Opium trade, Drug trafficking since Afghanistan is a part of golden crescent.
- Illegal migration: to India from Afghanistan
### India's response
- Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan composed of National Security Advisors’ (NSA) of regional countries and chaired by the Indian NSA. It adopted **Delhi Declaration** which focus on
	- Secure and Stable Afghanistan
	- Commitment from Regional countries to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in Afghanistan
	- Collective cooperation against the menace of radicalization, extremism, separatism and drug trafficking in the region
	- Central Role of UN
	- Ensuring Fundamental Rights of the people
- India raised the issue of Afghanistan’s future following the takeover by the Taliban in G20.
- In the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures (CICA) meeting held in in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, India underscored the importance of the Taliban regime meeting the expectations of the international community as elaborated in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593.
### Way forward
- Engaging with Taliban: Talking to the Taliban would allow India to seek security guarantees from the insurgents in return for continued development assistance or other pledges as well as explore the possibility of the Taliban’s autonomy from Pakistan.
- Inclusive Government: The solution comes only through the formation of an inclusive government with the participation of all ethnic groups.
- ==India should prevent Taliban regime from being a pawn of Pakistan.== Make sure that Pak-based anti-India terrorist group do not get support from Taliban.
- Engaging with other players.
	- Chinese cooperation: India should talk with China, with the objective of finding a political settlement and lasting stability in Afghanistan.
	- Russian Support: Russia has cultivated links with the Taliban in recent years. India would need Russia’s support in any form of direct engagement with the Taliban.
- Broader Diplomatic Engagement: India should consider appointing a special envoy dedicated to Afghanistan. The envoy can ensure that Indian views are expressed at every meeting and broaden engagement with the Taliban.
- Global Cooperation: No major power would like to see Afghanistan re-emerge as a global sanctuary of terror.
- Leverage Indian Infrastructural Developments: India should not stop the development work in Afghanistan and continue the good work.

India has to work with Taliban and other regional powers to protect its interests and stabilise Afghanistan. Establishing informal links with the Taliban government would put New Delhi in a stronger position to ensure that its assets and investments in Afghanistan aren’t imperiled. If India remains active and patient too, many opportunities could open up in the new Afghan phase.

### Threat of Narco-terrorism
- Threat of the rise of a Narco-terrorist state from Afghan soil.
	- According to [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\|UNODC]], Opium production has increased manifolds.
	- Entering India through sea, land and air routes involving Indian neighbours including Pakistan and African countries.
	- Production of counterfeit currency.
	- Potential rise in other organized crimes.

## Way forward
- Why India must, in its won national interest, begin open talks with Taliban?
	- India's original hesitation in opening talks with Taliban has cut India out of the current reconciliation process.
	- India's investments in Afghan ($3 billion)
	- Preventing Taliban becoming a pawn of Rawalpindi.
	- To make sure that Pakistan based anti-India terror groups do not get support from Taliban.
	- Large number of international community are going to recognise/negotiate/do business with Taliban
	- India needs to court all parties in Afghan, including Taliban.
	- Other players like China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran will emerge as the shapers of Afghanistan's  political and geopolitical destiny.
	- Proactive engagement with Taliban would provide an opportunity to open up the congested north-western frontier. 
- Regional solution: There is a convergence of interests between India and three key regional players - China, Russia and Iran in seeing a political settlement in Afghanistan.
	- None of these countries would like to see the Taliban taking over Afghan militarily, which means there would be an isolated Sunni Islamist regime in a country with fractured ethnic equations.
	- Taliban is saying they will not allow Afghan soil to be used by any terrorist organization. It is in India's interest to make Taliban walk the talk. This needs to be pursued more through regional diplomacy than bilateral engagement. India must insist on Taliban to keep their commitment on forming an inclusive government.
	- Third regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan called for urgent humanitarian assistance to Afghan people. Pakistan and China did not join.
	- Thus, there is a need for cooperation from like minded countries on this front.
- Short Term and Long Term Goal: 
	- India’s immediate goal should be the safety and security of its personnel and investments.
	- The long-term goal should be finding a political solution to the crisis. None of this can be achieved unless it works together with the regional powers.
- Russian Support: Russia has cultivated links with the Taliban in recent years. India would need Russia’s support in any form of direct engagement with the Taliban.
- Significance of Iran: Iran shares a long border with Afghanistan and has close resemblance of ethnic minorities.
	- The original objective of India’s Chabahar project in Iran was to create a direct access to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.
	- This direct access is critical for India in all different scenarios - move supplies to Afghanistan in larger quantities, retain its presence in the event of a civil war or carry out covert operations if the Taliban take power by force.
	- However, the US's pressure on India is a roadblock in good relations between the two countries.
- Bonhomie With China: India should talk with China, with the objective of finding a political settlement and lasting stability in Afghanistan.

>India, as impacted by the consequences of American withdrawal, has to work with Eurasian powers to protect its interests and stabilise Afghanistan. If India remains active and patient too, many opportunities could open up in the new Afghan phase. #conclusion

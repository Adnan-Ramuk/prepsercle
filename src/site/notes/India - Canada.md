# India - Canada
India-Canada relations have historically been characterized by diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. However, recent developments have brought some friction, particularly on issues related to separatist movements and foreign policy.
## Significance
- Supplier of Energy and Remittance.
	- **Uranium supply agreement in 2015**.
- About 1.5 million Indians in Canada.
- Bilateral Investment and Promotion agreement.
- MoU for space cooperation.
## Key Areas of Cooperation

1. **Trade and Investment**: India and Canada have a strong trade relationship, with bilateral trade valued at around $8.2 billion in 2022. Key exports from India to Canada include pharmaceuticals, textiles, and IT services, while Canada exports commodities like pulses, fertilizers, and aerospace components. Both countries are working on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) to further enhance trade, but progress has been slow due to various policy differences.
    
2. **Energy**: Canada is one of the largest suppliers of uranium to India, following a 2015 agreement that allows Canadian companies to supply uranium for India’s civilian nuclear program. This agreement supports India’s growing energy needs and contributes to its clean energy goals.
    
3. **Education and People-to-People Ties**: Canada is a popular destination for Indian students, with over 200,000 Indian students currently enrolled in Canadian universities. The Indian diaspora in Canada is significant, with over 1.4 million people of Indian origin, many of whom are influential in Canadian society. Cultural ties are strong, reinforced by festivals, community events, and a shared interest in multiculturalism.
    
4. **Technology and Innovation**: The two countries collaborate in various fields of innovation, including clean technology, artificial intelligence, and life sciences. Indian IT firms have a strong presence in Canada, and partnerships are emerging in areas like smart cities and healthcare.

### Recent Challenges

1. **Khalistan Separatist Issue**: A major sticking point in India-Canada relations has been Canada’s approach to the Khalistan separatist movement. India has expressed concerns over perceived support for Khalistan sympathizers in Canada, particularly as some Canadian politicians have shown support for this cause, which India views as a threat to its territorial integrity.
    
2. **Diplomatic Tensions and Sanctions**: Relations have been further strained by recent diplomatic confrontations, including Canada’s accusation of Indian involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil, which India denied. In response, both countries expelled diplomats, and visa processing was suspended for Canadian citizens in India.
    
3. **Foreign Policy Differences**: Canada’s approach to issues like human rights, as well as its stance on certain international policies, has occasionally diverged from India’s, causing friction. The two countries often differ on their positions in multilateral forums, which has made collaboration challenging.

### Strategic Importance and Future Outlook

Despite these tensions, Canada remains important for India’s energy security and as a key trade partner. Meanwhile, India’s large market and strategic position make it valuable to Canada. Diplomatic efforts continue to address the challenges while recognizing mutual benefits in areas like trade, innovation, and clean energy.

Moving forward, successful relations will likely depend on resolving or mitigating tensions around sensitive issues like separatism and building on common economic and cultural interests.

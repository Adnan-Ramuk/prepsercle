# CTBTO
- CTBTO is the supporting organization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). It promotes the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) so that it can enter into force.
- It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996 and opened for signature. 
- So far, 184 countries have signed the treaty and 168 of them have also ratified it (most recently Ghana on 14 June 2011).
- CTBTO has been trying to build trust with India and address its concerns which have restricted India from joining it.
- The Treaty’s entry into force depends on 44 specific States that must have signed and ratified the Treaty. 
	- These States had nuclear facilities at the time the Treaty was negotiated and adopted. 
	- As of August 2011, 35 of these States have ratified the Treaty.
	- Nine States still need to do so: China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan and the United States. 
	- India, North Korea and Pakistan have not yet signed the Treaty.
	- All 44 States are listed in the Treaty’s Annex 2.
- CTBTO establishes a verification regime to monitor adherence to the treaty.

## CTBT verification regime
- The CTBT verification regime is a unique, comprehensive system, consisting of the International Monitoring System (IMS), International Data Centre (IDC) and on-site inspections (OSI). It constantly monitors the planet for nuclear explosions and shares its findings with Member States (the 182 States that have signed the Treaty).
- India is not a member of CTBTO.
- India has been recently invited to join Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) in the capacity of an observer. 
	- Joining as an observer will let India know what is going on this front and obtain benefits from its information without actually binding itself to the treaty (CTBT).
	- Being an observer would give India access to data from the International Monitoring System - a network which when complete will consist of 337 facilities (321 monitoring stations and 16 radionuclide labs) located in 89 countries. 
	- This system can detect even small nuclear explosions using seismology, hydro acoustics, infrasound and radionuclide technology.
## Why is the CTBT so important?
- The CTBT is the last barrier on the way to develop nuclear weapons. 
- It curbs the development of new nuclear weapons and the improvement of existing nuclear weapon designs. 
- When the Treaty enters into force it provides a legally binding norm against nuclear testing. 
- The Treaty also helps prevent human suffering and environmental damages caused by nuclear testing.

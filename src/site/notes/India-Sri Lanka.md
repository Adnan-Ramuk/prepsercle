# Palk Bay fisheries conflict
- The problem is historical, complex and layered.
- Fishing disputes have been a constant area of concern between the two South Asian neighbours for a long time. Sri Lanka has long expressed concerns about illegal fishing by Indian fishermen within its territorial waters across the **Palk Strait**. The country regularly arrests Indian fishermen for crossing the **International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL)** that demarcates Indian and Sri Lankan waters. India also detains Sri Lankan fishermen for the illegal fishing.
- Due to their difference in the IMBL perception and also the claim of “**Traditional fishing grounds**” by the fishermen of both sides have flared up.
- The Indian fishermen venture deep into Lankan waters and fish near the SL coast posing a security threat to Lanka and affecting the livelihood of Lankan fishermen.
- They also use **heavy mechanized trawlers** due to which the nets of the Lankan Tamils are destroyed along with the ecosystem.
	- India introduced mechanised fishing using bottom trawlers between 1950's and 1970's with the financial help from Norwegian government 
- Rather than be engaged in solving strategic issues, officials are preoccupied in pleading for the release of Tamil Nadu fishermen, which is interpreted by Colombo as doing India a favour.
## Impact of fishermen conflict
### Impact on bilateral ties
- Along with Sri Lankan civil war use of bottom trawlers also resulted in strained ties.
- Joint Working Group with senior officials from both sides
## Impact on livelihoods of people
- heart of this problem is insecurity of fishermen community about their livelihoods and future.
### Ecological concerns
- Some uses thangoosi valai or monofilament nets, widely considered harmful for marine species.

## Katchatheevu Island
- It is an uninhabited island that India ceded to Sri Lanka in 1974 based on a conditional agreement called “**Kachchatheevu island pact**”.
- The central government recognizes Sri Lanka’s sovereignty over the island as per the 1974 accord. But Tamil Nadu claimed that Katchatheevu falls under the Indian territory and Tamil fishermen have traditionally believed that it belongs to them and therefore want to preserve the right to fish there.

#### SUGGESTIONS to solve fisherman issues
- Both countries can work out together to evolve agreement to permit licensed Indian fishermen to fish in Lankan waters.
- Establish a **Joint Palk Bay Authority** comprising representatives of the governments of India and Sri Lanka, fisheries and marine experts and fishermen of both the countries to regulate fishing activity in the Bay.
- The authority could decide the permissible annual catch, type of fishing equipment to be used, allot equitable fishing dates to both groups of fishermen (three days each per week for the two sides and one-day holiday), define non-fishing zones, identify means of safeguarding interests of traditional fishermen and identify alternative livelihood too.
- Fishermen from the India can be rehabilitated by deploying them in deep sea fishing and processing vessels.
- Start joint-venture initiatives involving Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen in deep sea fishing by introducing multiday boats and giant fishing and fish-processing vessels in international waters. It will act as a boost for the deteriorated relations.
- Indian Navy and Coast Guard and their SL counterparts should engage more, evolve standard practices, and coordinate more on information sharing and other Confidence building measures (CBM).

### Trade/Economic Issues
- CEPA negotiations failed. Sri Lanka not ready to sign FTA in services.
- Now discussions going on for ETCA- Economics & Technological Cooperation Agreement.
- Sri Lanka pulled out from tripartite agreement between India Japan and Sri Lanka, for developing Columbo's East Container Terminal. Set back for India and Japan, The project worth an estimated  $500-700 million. Sri Lanka offered Western Container Terminal (WCT) of Colombo port to India and Japan as a compromise.
	- its development would require greater investment and take more time to be profitable.
### Domestic Political unrest
- Sri Lanka accuses India for meddling in internal affairs.
## Way Forward
- India and Sri Lanka being democratic countries should focus on deepening and broadening of ties.
- Both countries should try to work out a permanent solution to the issue of fishermen through bilateral engagements.
- Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) or ETCA must be signed to improve the economic cooperation between both countries.
- India needs to focus more on its traditional and cultural ties to improve relations with Sri Lanka.
- Focus on tourism.
- Use multilateral diplomacy- SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA.
- Starting of ferry services between India and Sri Lanka can improve people to people linkages.
- Mutual recognition of each other's concerns and interests can improve the relationship between both countries to build Indian Ocean Community.
- More engagements in Climate diplomacy.

India-Lanka ties must elevate from current transactional phase to one that is more strategic.

- As quoted by PM Modi, India Bhutan relationship is like ‘**milk and water**‘. They cannot be separated. Therefore, India should leave no stone unturned to maintain good relations with Bhutan.
- India needs to complete some of the hydropower projects that were delayed due to lack of sufficient funds.
- India has a very good relationship with Bhutan whereas China has many border disputes with Bhutan. This relationship and goodwill must be maintained to counter China’s strategic calculations in Bhutan.
- Focus on [[India’s soft power#India’s soft power\|soft power]]
- India needs to augment the connectivity of Bhutan and its [[Development of North East\|North Eastern states]] for the region’s economic development.

# International Monetary Fund (IMF)
## IMF in managing #COVID-19 pandemic
IMF created a policy tracker summarizing the key economic responses of 196 economies, because sharing information, data, and analysis is a unique way we can add value for our members.
### New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB)
- The NAB constitutes a second line of defense to supplement IMF resources to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system. Through the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), a number of member countries and institutions stand ready to lend additional resources to the IMF.
- The NAB was proposed for the first time at the 1995 G-7 Halifax Summit following the Mexican financial crisis. In January 1997, the IMF’s Executive Board adopted a decision establishing the NAB, which became effective in November 1998. The NAB was revived in the context of the global financial crisis in 2009; to meet the lending requirements of the Eurozone crisis.
- In January 2020, the IMF’s Executive Board approved a doubling of the NAB resources from the current SDR 182 billion to SDR 365 billion, for a new NAB period from 2021 to 2025.
### Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
- The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) was created as a supplementary international reserve asset in the context of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system.
- The SDR is neither a currency nor a claim on the IMF. Rather, it is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members. SDRs can be exchanged for these currencies.

## Extended Fund Facility
- The Extended Fund Facility is lending facility of the Fund of the IMF and it was established in 1974 to help countries address medium- and longer-term balance of payments problems. 
- The EFF is prescribed for a country who is suffering from balance of payment problem caused by structural weaknesses and who need fundamental economic reforms. The use of the facility was discussed in recent Sri Lankan crisis.

# 5G
  >5G is the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. It succeeds the 4G (LTE/WiMax), 3G (UMTS) and 2G (GSM) systems. ==It's a high frequency (GHz range) low wavelength spectrum of communication.==  The 5G frequency bands in India include: 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300 MHz, and 26 GHz #definition #introduction 

 ## What is 5G?
- 5th generation of cellular mobile communication.
- Previous generations
	- 1g - 1980-82 in USA
	- 2g - GSM in Finland in 1992
	- 3g - Japan in 2001. - 0.2mbps - video. history of mobile apps began.
	- 4g - Improved speed

## Development of 5g across the world
Every country is looking at 5G as a technology to boost economic development.
- China officially announced 5g Era, China Japan and Korea are on the leading front.
- USA, AUSTRALIA And Canada  - concerned about privacy and Cyber security.
- India responded with ambitious actions. 
	- India is expected to be world's second largest smartphone market by 2025 with around 1 billion installed devices. 88 million going to be 5g enabled devices.
## Benefits of 5g technology
5g would drive future automation, AI, driverless cars, drones.
- 5G performance targets high data rate, reduced latency, energy saving, cost reduction, higher system capacity, and massive device connectivity.
- Till now cellular mobile communications were used mainly for mobile communication. 5G is also for industrial development.
- Speed: At least 10 times (up to 20) faster than current 4g system. 
	- HD movies can be downloaded in seconds. we will be watching 4k videos, without buffering. - boost to entertainment.
- More reliable.
- **Low communication latency**:
	-  Latency is the time it takes to pass a message from sender to receiver. Low communication latency is one improvement in 5G. Lower latency could help 5G mobile networks enable things such as multiplayer mobile gaming, factory robots, self-driving cars and other tasks demanding quick response. #definition 
- Enables new Applications: like IoT, Driverless cars, nanobots etc.
- Will improve overall connectivity in India.
- New and efficient transportation.
- Improved energy efficiency.
- Revolutionize education sector.
- Smart agriculture.
- Smart Governance.
## Challenges and Demerits
- **Technical**: Milli metre waves are absorbed by gases in the atmosphere and have shorter range than microwaves, therefore the cells are limited to smaller size; 5G cells will be the size of a city block, as opposed to the cells in previous cellular networks which could be many miles across. 
	- The waves also have trouble passing through building walls, requiring multiple antennas to cover a cell. Milli metre wave antennas are smaller than the large antennas used in previous cellular networks, only a few inches long, so instead of a cell tower 5G cells will be covered by many antennas mounted on telephone poles and buildings.
- **Economical**: Implementation of 5G will cost enormous and unjustifiable capital investment. 
	- Deployment is currently limited to cities, where there will be enough users per cell to provide an adequate investment return, and there are ==doubts about whether this technology will ever reach rural areas.==
- **Security and Privacy**: [[GS 3/INTERNAL SECURITY/Basics of Cybersecurity\|Cybersecurity]], [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]] issues, Surveillance.
- **Impact on environment and Health**: 
	- any technology improve communication reduce carbon emission, [[Greenhouse gas\|GHG]] etc.  so 5g would be environment friendly. (comparatively)
	- Adverse effects of 5g radiation.
	- Higher power concentrated on small areas.
	- harmful effects of electro-magnetic radiations. collapse of insect population. e.g.  **colony collapse of Bees.**
	- Retinal damage, neurological issues, cancer risks, etc.
- **Political**: Other potential tricky issues could relate to whether Huawei, which is currently the prime target in the US - China technology war, is allowed to participate in the 5G trials (telecom) in India.
## Need for a Desi 5G model
For inclusive and supportive of health care, education and farming.
- Indian players must be proactive, because country's appetite for mobile tech is going to be huge.
- we missed out opportunities around 2G, 3G and 4G.
- India has become the second biggest mobile manufacturer in the world.
- Qualcomm, And Bharati Airtel is tying up for 5G in India.

- India excluded, Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE in 5G trails. We cannot have bloodshed on border, good relationship in other domains : External Affairs Minister.

## Issues
- India unprepared for 5g roll-out - Parliamentary panel.
	- Factors coming in the way
		- Inadequate availability of spectrum
		- high spectrum prices
		- poor development of use cases
		- low status fiberisation
		- non uniform of right of way issues
		- deficient backhaul capacity
## WAY FORWARD
Concerns and issues should be adequately addressed before bringing new technologies, especially Disruptive technology like 5G.  5G would change our lives in multiple fronts.

# International Panel on Fissile Materials
- The **International Panel on Fissile Materials** (IPFM), established in 2006, is a group of independent nuclear experts from 17 countries: Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
- It aims to advance international initiatives to “secure and to sharply reduce all stocks of highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, the key materials in nuclear weapons, and to limit any further production”.
- The Panel produces an annual **Global Fissile Material Report** which summarizes new information on fissile material stocks and production worldwide, as well as periodic research reports

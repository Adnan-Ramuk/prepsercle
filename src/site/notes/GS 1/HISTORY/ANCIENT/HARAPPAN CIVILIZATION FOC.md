# HARAPPAN CIVILIZATION
- Total area - 13 lakh sqkm. Area wise it was larger than all other [[Bronze age civilisation\|Bronze age civilisation]]s. Diverse geographical features - river valley, coastal areas, hilly terrains etc.
- Period of Harappan civilization is divided into 3 phases;
	- Early Harappan age, **Regionalisation era** - 3500 BCE to 2600 BCE.
	- Mature Harappan or Urban Harappan - **Integration era** - 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE.
	- Late Harappan or **Localisation era**, **Post urban phase** - 1900 BCE onward.
- Mehragarh settlements in present day Baluchistan province of Pakistan predates IVC (7000 BCE). They produced wheat, cotton and lived in mud brick houses.

# Urban Planning in IVC
>To what extent has the urban planning and culture of the Indus Valley Civilization provided inputs to the present-day urbanization? Discuss. ( #PYMQ/anc/ivc #2014/200/12 )

>Would you agree that the drainage system in Harappan cities indicates town planning? Give reasons for your answer. #MPQ 

## Indicators of Urban planning in IVC
1. Grid system and street design: Roads were well cut dividing the town into large rectangular blocks. ==Lamp posts at intervals indicate the existence of street lightning.== Mesopotamia had haphazard (unplanned) growth.
2. Drainage system: The drains connecting from all the houses are connected to a near by central drain. Drains were made up of mortar, lime and gypsum and covered with large brick slabs for easy cleaning. It shows **developed sense of health and sanitation**. Manholes were constructed at regular intervals cleaning and maintenance. ==No other [[Bronze age civilisation\|Bronze age civilisation]] gave so much attention to the health and cleanliness as the Harappans did.== [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\|Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]]
3. Use of Burnt bricks of standard ratio: (length and breadth were four times and twice the height respectively) in all the sites. Elsewhere in contemporary world, mud-bricks were used. e.g. Egyptian Civilization.
4. Design of houses: Houses were monotonous - a square courtyard, around which were a number of rooms were built.
5. Mobilization of labour: huge walls and buildings.
6. Upper (citadel- Western part, smaller in area but built at a higher elevation) and lower cities (larger in area): both walled. The citadel of Harappan provides ingredients to the modern day social structure.
7. Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of **Shortughai in Afghanistan**
8. Extraordinary uniformity in patterns of seals, crafts and pottery.

## Evidence of authority
- Uniformity in artifacts, seals, weights and bricks.
- Settlements in strategic locations. 
- Labour was mobilized. 
- "Priest King" figure.
- Presence of citadel. Citadel had Great bath, warehouses and granaries.
- Planned settlements.
## Harappan Cities/Sites
### Dholavira
- 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



- Dholavira and Ramappa temple in Telangana added to the  UNESCO World Heritage list in 2021. 

</div></div>

- It is the first site of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC) in India to get the tag.
- After Mohen-jo-Daro, Ganweriwala, and Harappa in Pakistan and Rakhigarhi in Haryana of India, **Dholavira is the fifth largest metropolis of IVC.**
- The site has a fortified citadel, a middle town, and a lower town with walls made of sandstone or limestone instead of mud bricks in many other Harappan sites.
- **Dholavira has one of the world’s earliest water conservation systems ever excavated.**
	- Satellite pictures show a **reservoir underground**, an expertly constructed rainwater harvesting system extending from the walls of the city, without which the settlement would not have thrived in the sparse rainfall of the desert.
- Multi layered defensive mechanisms
- Special burial site

# Agriculture in IVC
>The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) stands as one of the most remarkable ancient civilizations in history, thriving around 2600 to 1900 BCE in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent. Among its many achievements, the IVC was at the forefront of agricultural innovation, introducing practices that continue to influence modern farming. #introduction 
- The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was the first civilization to produce cotton.
- They practiced agriculture and domesticated cattle, dogs, and cats.
- Evidences of ploughed fields have been found in Kalibangan, and terracotta models of ploughs have been discovered in Banawali.
- The crops cultivated in the IVC included wheat, barley, peas, and rice. Historians suggest that multicropping was practiced, indicating advanced agricultural techniques.
- For water storage, the IVC used gabarbands or Nala's.
- Surplus food was stored in granaries. Notably, the granary at Harappa was more advanced compared to the one found at Mohen-jo-Daro.
    - The Harappa granary featured two rows of six rooms each, with a brick-lined walkway in the middle.
    - The rooms were separated from each other through air ducts, providing safety against flooding and pest attacks.
- The IVC's agricultural success can be attributed to their sophisticated urban planning, efficient water management, and well-designed irrigation systems.
	- The efficient water management and irrigation systems of the Indus Valley Civilization allowed them to cope with periods of low rainfall, ensuring a stable food supply for their growing urban centers.
- Archaeological evidence suggests that the IVC might have also cultivated various other crops, including sesame, mustard, and sugarcane.
- The use of manure and organic waste as fertilizers played a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
- The existence of extensive trade networks facilitated the exchange of agricultural products, leading to economic growth and cultural exchange.

>The IVC's agricultural practices laid the foundation for future civilizations in the Indian subcontinent. #conclusion

# Trade and Commerce in IVC
- The Harappans carried on a considerable trade in stone, metal, shell, etc., within the Indus culture zone. However, the cities did not possess basic raw materials for the commodities they produced. In return for finished goods and possibly food grains, they procured metals from the neighboring areas by boats and bullock carts.
- They followed Barter system, indicated by absence of coins.
	- Weights and measures (16 was unit of measure). 
- Bead making existed in Chanhaduro. 
- The Indus valley people set up trading colonies to facilitate long distance trade. For example, they had set up a trading colony in northern Afghanistan which evidently facilitated trade with Central Asia.
- The trade of lapis lazuli, cotton and other export and import commodities with Mesopotamia, Sumerian can be considered as the origin of modern day long distance commerce. 
## Contact with other civilizations
- Copper coming from a region called Magan (Oman).
- Harappan jars and seals found in Oman.
- Harappan motifs on Cylindrical Mesopotamian seals (e.g. bulls).
- Harappan weights and measurements at Dilmun - Island of Bahrain.
- Mesopotamian text mentions about trade with **Meluha** - Harappans. (Announcement of Sargon of Akkad)
- More than 2 dozen Harappan seals discovered from Mesopotamian cities like Ur.
- Their usage of seals and stamps on traded objects to indicate the place of origin and to protect them from tampering is similar to present day practice of encryption and coding.

- Bead making was common.
- ==Absence of spoke wheels.==
- Seals were made of terracotta, soapstone etc. with some inscriptions.
- Pasupati seal - aka proto Shiva
	- Similar to Mahayogi posture and Trimukha posture of Hinduism.

# Spiritual and religious life of Harappans
- No evidence of an established religion. No temples found.
	- They practiced idolatry. Pashupati Shiva, Mother Goddesses and Priest King.
	- Phallus (lingam) and Yoni worship. (fertility cult)
	- Trees, stones and animals were worshiped - Animism.
- Great bath at Mohenjodaro.(on the banks of Indus river) 
	- The strong belief of sanctity of water by Harappan’s resembles to the belief of south Indians who keep water tank in temples is a cultural input to modern day civilization. 
- Seals having ritual scenes. One horned rhinoceros - unicorn. 
- Fire altars at Lothal and Kalibangan.
- Burials : Recently discovered Brick-lined burials (as opposed to plain pits) in Rakhigarhi were among the most elaborately constructed graves, and possibly implied a high social or ritual status.
- A new school of thought suggest that diverse religious practices co-existed. Because only small number of burials had been found. Rest might had cremated their body or disposed it in rivers.
- ==Overall a secular way of life==.
- No evidence of varna system or discrimination towards women.
- In general lack of evidences shows that IVC people had no institutionalised religion in modern sense.

>Terracotta figurines and seals throw some light on the religious practices followed by Harappans. Discuss. #MPQ

# Decline of IVC

- Major decrease in the strength of [[Monsoon\|Monsoon]]
- [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] shifted the centre of gravity of Indian history. 
	- Decline of urban settlements and evidence of migration to east and south to rural areas.
	- According to a research conducted, about 2000 BCE, there was a rise in aridity in USA, Australia and India.
	- As a result people might have totally depended on river Ghaggar-Hakra.
- Tectonics movement followed by flood.
- over grazing resulting in degradation of soil.
- Saraswati river dried out.
- Aryan Invasion theory by Sir Mortimer Wheeler - discarded. (only talks Mohen-jo-Daro)

>What are the causes of decline of IVC. Discuss the extent of role played by factors leading to the inception of Meghalayan age. #MPQ

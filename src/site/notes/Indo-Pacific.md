# Indo-Pacific
New Delhi's Indo-Pacific vision is premised on "[[India - ASEAN\|ASEAN]] centrality and the common pursuit of prosperity" 
[[India-EU\|EU]] recently acknowledged that the path to its future is through enhanced influence in the Indo-Pacific, while stressing that the strategy is not anti-China.
The incorporation of the Indo-Pacific concept in Indian diplomacy means that India can no longer be confined between Malacca strait and Gulf of Aden.


INDO PACIFIC WARM POOL
The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool holds a unique place on the globe. It is a large
area 30 × 106 km that is characterized by permanent surface temperature >28 °C and is therefore called the ‘heat engine’ of the globe. 
Waters from the western Pacific Ocean are transferred into the eastern Indian
Ocean via the many passageways across the Indonesian Archipelago. A large portion
of those seas are shallow and saddle the equator. As a result, sea-surface temperatures
remain hot (>28 °C) the whole year, but water salinities vary significantly as a result of
seasonal monsoonal activity and fluxes from large rivers. Because of the shallowness of
the seas, especially around a large part of Indonesia and north of Australia, and they are
associated with hot temperatures, this area has been coined the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool
(IPWP). This region is quite extensive as it covers a surface area equivalent to that of the
entire USA.

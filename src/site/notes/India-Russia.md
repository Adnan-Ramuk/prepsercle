# India - Russia
>India and Russia enjoys a time-tested relation. World's largest country and World's largest democracy are two significant poles in the multipolar world. #introduction 
## Brief background of India-Russia relations
- Signed treaty of Friendship and Peace in 1971.
- Signed Declaration on the India-Russia strategic Partnership in 2000 and elevated to the level of Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership in 2010.
### Peace treaty with Soviet
- This treaty played a very significant role in safeguarding India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
- The relevance of the treaty can be judged only by the geopolitical and strategic context under which it was signed. There was a growing **China-USA-Pakistan axis**. If India were to wage a war on Pakistan, it may face all the three powers.
- In this backdrop, India and USSR moved closer to ink the historic Indo-Soviet treaty of peace to neutralise the effect of the emerging axis and defend their vital geopolitical interests.
- Treaty had effectively restrained Pakistan and her allies from embarking on a course of military adventurism in the subcontinent and would continue to act as a deterrent against the hegemonic goals.
- It also improved our relationship with Soviet which played a great role in solving energy crisis of India to an extent.
- It was also a shift from [[Non Alignment Movement\|non-alignment]] in our foreign policy to realistically protect our interests.
- >When was the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation between the Republic of India and the Union of Soviet Republic signed? What are the important of the treaty and what is its duration? How has the Treaty served India’s interests? Does it affect India’s position as a prominent members of the Non-aligned Group of Nations. #PYMQ 1981

# BIMSTEC
>Bay of Bengal Initiatives for Multi-sectoral, Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional group of seven members: Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, and Nepal, established in 1997 through **Bangkok Declaration**. #introduction 

- BIMSTEC, which now includes five countries from South Asia and two from ASEAN, is a bridge between South Asia and Southeast Asia.

## Importance of BIMSTEC:
- Over one-fifth (22%) of the world’s population live in the seven countries around it, and they have a combined GDP close to $2.7 trillion. #facts 
- The Bay also has vast untapped natural resources.
- For India, it is a natural platform to fulfil our key foreign policy priorities of ‘Neighbourhood First’ and ‘Act East’.
- BIMSTEC act as a bulwark against Chinese aggression in the neighbouring waters.
- BIMSTEC provide alternate to SAARC as means of regional cooperation and integration.
- As whole region is severely under connected, the region as a whole has huge potential and chance for India to take a lead in the region
- Bay region is a key transit route between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. Therefore, BIMSTEC as a grouping can help in ensuring freedom of navigation in the waters.
- Regional cooperation is essential in tackling the drug trafficking and arm proliferation in the region.
- BIMSTEC can boost the development of the northeast region by providing greater interaction with Bangladesh and Myanmar.
## Challenges of BIMSTEC development:
- Stalemate on Agreements: The Free Trade Agreement (FTA), coastal shipping agreement, and motor vehicle agreement have undergone numerous negotiations. But so far, no consensus is developed over them.
- Priority to Bilateralism: The members of the organization focused primarily on enhancing bilateral ties, with multilateralism. This restricts the development of BIMSTEC despite having common ecological concerns and a shared past.
- Big brother attitude: Allegations are made on India for playing a dominant role in the organisation and neglecting the agendas of small states.
- Irregularity in working: The summits are not held at regular intervals. A slow pace is observed in working. For instance, it took almost 17 years to establish a permanent secretariat.
- Preference to other organisations: Countries like Myanmar and Thailand show more enthusiasm towards ASEAN and neglect the vision of BIMSTEC.
- Resource Deficit: Lack of adequate financial and manpower resources is impairing the performance of the body. Although, India is the largest contributor. India alone contributes about 32% of the annual budget of BIMSTEC.
## Steps taken by India to strengthen ties with Southeast Asian nation:
- Cooperation on Regional Initiatives: India is steering a number of sub-regional programmes and projects such as the BBIN corridor, Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway, Kaladan multimodal project etc.
- Indian signed FTA with the ASEAN countries. India is now the 4th largest trading partner of ASEAN.
- Training of BIMSTEC Diplomats at the Foreign Service Institute, etc.
- Organizing Tri-Services Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief – HADR Exercise-code-named ‘Tiger Triumph’ is aimed at developing inter-operability between the militaries of the two countries.
- BIMSTEC Centre for Weather and Climate, being hosted in India, is fully functional with the state-of-the-art facilities to provide Disaster Early Warnings.
- India will lead the security pillar out of the seven designated pillars of the revived BIMSTEC.


The year 2022 will mark the silver jubilee of the organization and would provide a symbolic opportunity to strengthen regional cooperation and multilateral ties. Considering this, India and other member states must work on 3Cs – cooperation, coordination, and collaboration that would unleash the true potential of BIMSTEC.

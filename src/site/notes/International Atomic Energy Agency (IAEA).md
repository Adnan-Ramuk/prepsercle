# International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)


Nuclear watchdog under the [[United Nations Organisation (UNO)\|United Nations Organisation (UNO)]]. Works wit its member states and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of [[Awareness in the filed of Nuclear Science\|Nuclear technology]]. 
Entrusted with the task of upholding the principles of [[Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\|Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)]] of 1970.

## Achievements
- Signing of [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)\|Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)]] in 2015
- Provided platform for the discussion about civil nuclear requirement for several countries.
- Active in championing civil nuclear solutions in areas like health, medicine etc.
- Active in dealing with [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]], pandemic containment and in prevention of zoonotic diseases.
- IAEA was the first to announce the North Korean nuclear programme is not peaceful.

## Failures
- Could not function independently without being drawn into big power rivalries.
	- e.g. did not pursue the case of Pakistan's nuclear programme despite strong evidences because of the cooperation of Pakistan and USA on the Afghan front.
- Never challenged the nuclear dominance of P5


==IAEA is an imperfect system but it's better than nothing.==

The **International Energy Agency (IEA)** and the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)** are two crucial organizations addressing global energy and nuclear security challenges, with significant implications for member states and partners like India.

### IEA's Role

- **Establishment and Purpose**: Founded in 1974, the IEA was created to enhance energy security among its members, especially in response to the oil crises of that era. Over time, its focus has broadened to include promoting sustainable energy solutions.
- **Energy Security**: The IEA monitors global energy markets, helping to coordinate responses to major supply disruptions and providing analyses to ensure stable energy supplies.
- **Clean Energy Transition**: It offers policy guidance and data support to assist countries in transitioning to renewable energy sources, which is vital for mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency.

### IAEA's Role

- **Establishment and Purpose**: Established in 1957, the IAEA's mission centers on promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy while preventing the diversion of nuclear materials for military purposes.
- **Nuclear Non-Proliferation**: The IAEA is pivotal in verifying adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) through its inspection and safeguarding mechanisms.
- **Safety Standards**: The agency develops international nuclear safety standards and provides technical assistance to countries looking to safely develop nuclear energy for peaceful applications.

### India's Engagement

- **With the IEA**: Although not a member, India collaborates closely with the IEA as a strategic partner, actively engaging in discussions and initiatives focused on energy security and renewable energy development.
- **With the IAEA**: India is a significant player in the IAEA, leveraging its robust nuclear energy program, which serves both civilian and military needs. This participation helps India align its energy ambitions with global non-proliferation objectives.

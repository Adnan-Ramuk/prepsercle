# United Nations Organisation (UNO)
>One of outcomes of the Second World War was the formation of the UNO for safeguarding the world from another world war and the preserving peace in the globe.

- The failure of the League of Nations and the outbreak of the War prompted the thinking men of the times for setting up of a more powerful international organisation for global peace and security. 
- It was in 1941 that Franklin Roosevelt, the president of the U S and Winston Churchill, the prime minister of England made the first effort and resultant Atlantic Charter was published. This Charter envisaged the setting up of a permanent system of global security against aggression and war. 
- In the following year, an international conference was held in January in Washington. This conference attended by 26 nations accepted the Atlantic Charter and issued the Washington Declaration. 
- It is in this Declaration that the term ‘United Nations’ was used for the first time. The detailed plan and structure of the body were discussed and prepared at the subsequent conferences held in Moscow, Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta. 
- These were followed by the San Francisco Conference. This Conference met in April 1945, completed the task of making final drafting and adopting the Charter of the United Nations. It was signed and approved by 51 member nations and the UNO formally came into existence on 24th October 1945.
- The Article 1 of the Charter enumerates the basic objectives of the UN. They include:
	- To maintain international peace and security
	- To develop friendly relations among nations of the world
	- To solve economic, social and other problems through international co-operation and
	- To serve as centre for harmonising collective action in order to achieve these common objectives.
- To achieve these objectives, the UN has different organs: The General Assembly, The Security Council, The Secretariat, The International Court of Justice, The Trusteeship Council and The Economic and Social Council. Besides these, the UN has other specialised organs as well.
	- The General Assembly is composed of all the members of the UN. Each nation has one vote and it is not a legislative body and is entitled to discuss all questions falling within the scope of the UN Charter.
	- The Security Council is the most powerful organ of the UN. It is designed to provide instructions and leadership to the functions of the UN as a whole. It is the powerful body and has been bestowed with real powers. The membership of this organ consists of Five Permanent and Ten Non permanent members. The Permanent members are China, Russia, the US, France and Britain, who are denoted as ‘Big Five’. Both these groups are elected for a period of two years. The Permanent members enjoy veto power that often mal administers this body. The Security Council is primarily responsible for the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security. It has the actual power to investigate any disputes or conflicts that may lead to tension or war. It is the apex body that controls the UN.
	- The Secretariat is in charge of administrative and technical works of the UN. It is the office staff and amounts to almost 50,000 employees. Its head is the Secretary General elected for a period of five years by the General Assembly on the basis of the recommendations of the Security Council. The Secretary General chairs all meetings and he is the spokesperson of the UN. More than an administrator and a technocrat, the Secretary General is a diplomat in the sense that rather than interfering, he intervenes and tries to settle issues.
	- The Trusteeship Council is the supervisory body to administer territories, whose people have not yet won self government in its modern sense. Thus the council works for the governance of these non self governing territories and prepare themselves for getting independence.
	- The International Court of Justice is the judicial organ of the UN and works for settling all legal issues. It has 15 judges elected for nine years by the General Assembly and Security Council jointly. But it has no power to arrest and punish those who violate the norms of the UN.
	- The Economic and Social Council is the Co-ordinating body of almost all UN activities. It is concerned with all non political activities like health, education, empowerment and other matters of social and economic significance. Thus it manages and appoints various commissions for settling population problems, drug problems, the issues of human right violations and travails of women. It is now known as ECOSOC.
- Apart from these agencies, the UN has number of specialised bodies, most of which are under the jurisdiction of the ECOSOC. 
- The most important agencies are the Universal Postal Union (UNUPU), the International Telecommunications Union (UNITU), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)
- The specialised agencies of the UN also include certain financial and economic bodies like the World Bank or the International Bank for [[Rural Development\|Rural Development]] (IBRD), International Monetary Fund ([[International Monetary Fund (IMF)\|IMF]]), and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT).
- The activities and functions of the UN are three fold: Peace keeping, decolonisation and socio economic and humanitarian concerns. 
- As an international organisation, the UN has been and continues to be in the forefront of preventing another World War as well as preventing many wars and conflicts. 
- It also stands in the main stream in settling disputes and conflicts, arranging cease fires, negotiations and mediations and deputing peace keeping force to maintain peace and security. It also plays a dominant role in curtailing arms and ammunitions and practicing disarmament.
- In the non political field, the UN has excelled in many ways. It has been making concerted efforts to accomplish socio economic and humanitarian reforms at their maximum by providing basic amenities to almost all people around the globe. 
- With the support of the international community, the UN has been in the forefront of safeguarding and protecting human rights all over the world.
- This doesn’t mean that the UN has nothing to achieve. The structure itself is a big limitation of the UN. The dominance of the big powers, the question of veto power and the shortage of army personnel have contributing for its minnow performance. 
- It has become a ‘Talking Body’ has raised questions regarding its existence. Moreover, it has become a tool in the hands of the US and a non united organisation.
- But despite these, in the unipolar world of domination, the UN has its own relevance. To certain extent it could prevent conflicts among nations ad with its glamour as an agency safeguarding human rights and providing basic amenities to the needy, the UN has an integral part of international politics and relations.

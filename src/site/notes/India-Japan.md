# India - Japan
### Historical Relations

India and Japan’s ties date back to the 6th century, with Buddhism playing a significant role in cultural exchanges. Indian culture, particularly through Buddhism, greatly influenced Japanese society, fostering a sense of closeness. Post-World War II, India and Japan strengthened diplomatic ties; in 1952, they signed a peace treaty, marking one of Japan's first international agreements after the war. India also helped Japan's recovery by supplying essential resources like iron ore. Since then, the countries have established a foundation of cooperation, with Japan providing yen loans to India as early as 1958, and later assisting during India's 1991 balance of payments crisis.

### Recent Developments

In 2022, high-level visits by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized shared commitments to a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" and furthering bilateral cooperation across economic and defense spheres. Their "Special Strategic and Global Partnership" reflects an alignment in economic, security, and regional goals, countering increasing regional tensions from China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.

### Areas of Convergence

#### Economic and Commercial Relations

Economic exchanges have deepened, with the 2011 Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) accelerating trade and investment. Japan ranks as one of India's top investors, contributing significantly to infrastructure projects such as the Delhi Metro and India's high-speed rail network. Japan has been a strategic investor in North-Eastern India and has committed funds for quality infrastructure projects across Asia and Africa.

#### Defense and Security

India and Japan’s defense cooperation is marked by the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation. They engage in multiple defense dialogues, including the “2+2” Foreign and Defense Ministerial Meeting, and conduct joint exercises like JIMEX, Dharma Guardian, and Malabar, which also includes the United States. The recent 2022 “2+2” summit reiterated their commitment to regional security and included agreements for greater defense integration, responding to Chinese and North Korean actions affecting the Indo-Pacific's stability.

#### Energy and Nuclear Cooperation

The 2017 nuclear cooperation agreement between India and Japan focuses on the peaceful use of nuclear technology, essential for India's energy needs and climate goals. The India-Japan Clean Energy Partnership (CEP) aims to foster transitions toward carbon neutrality, and both countries collaborate in projects like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and the International Solar Alliance (ISA).

#### Science and Technology

Cooperation spans digital and emerging technologies. The India-Japan Digital Partnership, launched in 2018, encourages joint research and development in fields such as AI and cybersecurity. The countries are also working on a lunar exploration mission, LUPEX, through their respective space agencies.

### Challenges and Issues

Despite these advancements, several issues persist. Japan's heavy reliance on the U.S. for security and China for trade can complicate its engagements with India. Economic ties, while growing, still haven’t reached their potential, and joint projects in regions like Africa and Iran have faced delays. India’s emphasis on data localization has also affected cybersecurity collaboration with Japan.

### Way Forward

Both nations can further strengthen their relationship by:

- Increasing market access and addressing investment concerns.
- Enhancing technology transfer to support India’s “Make in India” initiative.
- Utilizing Indian diaspora contributions in Japan.
- Deepening collaboration on clean energy and climate initiatives.

The Indo-Japanese partnership continues to have strategic importance, particularly as a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific and as a counterbalance to regional security challenges. The synergy between India and Japan supports their shared vision of a free, open, and rules-based Indo-Pacific.

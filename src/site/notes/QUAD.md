- ![Pasted image 20220410105427.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220410105427.png)
- Quad does not stand against anything, it stands for something. It is a platform to cooperate on economics, technology, climate and security.
- While security including [[India and Maritime security\|maritime security]] is a major agenda of Quad, but it is not military alliance.
- Spirit of the Quad - commitment to an open [[Indo-Pacific\|Indo-Pacific]] - free from coercion 
- PM - **Quad - a force for Global good**
- Quad grouping is also called as Diamond of Democracies.
## Recent developments
- Quad members agree to ensure equitable access to vaccines through a vaccine initiative: a billion vaccines by the end of 2022, made in India with U.S technology, Japanese funding and Australian distribution networks to reach as many [[Indo-Pacific\|Indo-Pacific]] countries as possible.
- Quad countries will focus on emission reduction based on [[Paris agreement\|Paris agreement]] as well as cooperate on technology supply chains, safe and transparent [[5G\|5G]] networks, [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/Awareness in the field of Biotechnology\|biotechnology]].

## Benefits for India
- More strategic support after a tensed year at the LAC
- Boost for its [[Pharmaceutical Industry\|Pharmaceutical Industry]]
- Opportunities for technological partnerships.
- More avenues for regional cooperation on development projects and financing infrastructure.
## Issues
- Core structural problem: it pivots around U.S
- India being dragged into the geopolitics of pacific, which is not a West pacific country like other members. Also only member which shares a land border (3,500 km undemarcated) with China.
- QUAD neither shares a strategic vision nor it is animated by a shared agenda.
- China - Russia relationship could counterbalance Quad
 
## Way forward
- Rebuilding ties with china should a priority concern for India .
- India should dilute its focus on Indo-pacific and accept that the borders and Indian Ocean are where its crucial interest lies. 
- Quad should not be about any single challenge or any single competitor.
- Boosting bilateral trade and business with QUAD partners could help meet the objectives captured in the "Spirit of the Quad"

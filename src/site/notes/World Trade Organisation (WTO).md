# World Trade Organisation (WTO)
>WTO aims to establish a rule based multilateral trading system.
- Dedicated to craft rules of trade through consensus. (not by voting)
- Strengthening WTO is in India's best interest.
- One of the biggest threat to efficacy of WTO is attitude of U.S, which is undermining WTO's dispute redressal mechanism - directly involved in almost half of all cases brought to WTO.
- IPRs and vaccine issue. [[GS 3/SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/Issues relating to IPR#Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights TRIPS\|TRIPS]] is a formidable barrier to ensuring equitable access to vaccines.
- No agreement on fisheries subsidies or e-commerce regulation.
- WTO is criticized for promoting the global interests of oligopolies. e.g. Investment Facilitation Agreement.
- Countries are not allowed to export food grains from public stock holding as they are procured at subsidised rates. (As per Uruguay rounds)
